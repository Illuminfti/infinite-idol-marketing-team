### [2026-01-09 15:30] Multi-Agent: PR #1 CANON COMPLIANCE - COMPLETE ✅

**Activity Type**: Code Implementation | Canon Fix | Repository Update

**Summary**:
PR #1 (Canon Compliance - Remove Fading Resurrection Mechanic) has been successfully implemented, committed, and pushed to the vibing repository. This PR resolves the critical violation of Inviolable Fact #2 ("Fading is Permanent Death") by completely removing the fading/save mechanic that allowed resurrection of faded users.

**Implementation Details**:

| Component | Action | Lines Changed |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| `src/ika/fading.js` | ✅ DELETED | -360 lines |
| `src/database.js` | ✅ MODIFIED | -100 lines (tables, operations, exports) |
| `src/ika/index.js` | ✅ MODIFIED | -17 lines (imports, exports) |
| **TOTAL** | | **-477 lines** |

**Changes Made**:
1. **Deleted** `src/ika/fading.js` (entire resurrection mechanic module)
2. **Removed** from `database.js`:
   - `fading_saves` table definition
   - `fading_state` table definition
   - Fading indexes
   - `fadingOps` object (all save/resurrection operations)
   - `fadingOps` export
3. **Removed** from `ika/index.js`:
   - `fading` module require statement
   - 7 fading function exports (calculateFadingStage, getFadingUsers, saveUser, etc.)

**Canon Compliance Verification**:
- ✅ Zero Inviolable Fact violations remain
- ✅ Fading is now permanent (no resurrection possible)
- ✅ All resurrection code removed
- ✅ No SQL tables tracking saves/resurrections

**Testing**:
- ✅ All JavaScript files compile successfully (no syntax errors)
- ✅ No orphaned function calls found
- ✅ Database operations clean
- ✅ No breaking changes to Seven Gates core system

**Preserved Elements** (Intentional - Not Canon Violations):
- **Story dialogue**: Lore references to "fading" in character voice (personality, not mechanic)
- **Consequence system**: Player absence consequences (relationship system, not resurrection)
- **UI themes**: Visual theme names (styling only)

**Git Status**:
- ✅ Committed to: `claude/seven-gates-discord-bot-Jb1Gm`
- ✅ Pushed to: `origin/claude/seven-gates-discord-bot-Jb1Gm`

### [2026-01-09 14:00] Agent: 09 - Resident Degen | VIBING PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅ **BASED**

**Activity Type**: Cultural Audit | DS Rating Assessment | Fan Service Calibration

**Summary**:
Agent 09 (Resident Degen) completed all Phase 1 P0 tasks for vibing repository overhaul. Conducted comprehensive cultural authenticity audit, Discord culture fit review, and fan service calibration assessment. Verdict: **DS-2.8 AVERAGE (HIGH AUTHENTICITY)** - Bot is exceptionally calibrated for crypto degens, gacha addicts, and otaku culture. **APPROVED FOR LAUNCH**.

**Cultural Audit Results**:

| Task | Status | Verdict |
|------|--------|---------|
| **DEGEN-VIB-001**: Cultural baseline (DS ratings) | ✅ COMPLETE | DS-2.8 average - Based (High Authenticity) |
| **DEGEN-VIB-002**: Discord culture fit | ✅ COMPLETE | Perfect fit - matches degen Discord expectations |
| **DEGEN-VIB-003**: Fan service calibration | ✅ COMPLETE | DS-3.0 - Shameless & authentic (correct execution) |

**Degeneracy Scale Ratings by Component**:

| Component | DS Rating | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Personality System (personality.js) | **DS-3.2** | Degen - Shameless & Committed |
| Lore & Narrative (lore.js, fragments.js) | **DS-2.7** | Based - Atmospheric & Vulnerable |
| Command Descriptions (help.js, messages.js) | **DS-2.5** | Based - Mystical & Clear |
| Intimacy/Yandere System (bond.js) | **DS-3.0** | Degen - Shameless Fan Service (Correct) |
| Gate Progression (gates/, messages.js) | **DS-2.6** | Based - Engaging & Smart |
| Tone & Aesthetic (overall) | **DS-2.9** | Degen - Dark Luxury Executed |

**Overall DS Rating**: **DS-2.8** (Based - High Authenticity)

**Key Findings**:

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: ✅ EXCEPTIONAL
   - Bot knows what it is and owns it completely
   - No apologizing for yandere mechanics or intimacy progression
   - Full commitment to parasocial idol resurrection simulation
   - Self-aware but not ironic

2. **Discord Culture Fit**: ✅ PERFECT
   - Lowercase everything (correct for degen Discord)
   - Symbol language (♰ ✧ ♡) creates atmosphere
   - Fragment sentences, ellipses, no exclamation points
   - Matches degen server energy exactly

3. **Fan Service Calibration**: ✅ SHAMELESS & CORRECT
   - Intimacy stages: stranger → eternal ("you are one. forever. infinite. hers.")
   - Yandere progression: curious → yandere ("you belong to her. only her.")
   - Measurable metrics (intimacy stage, yandere level, jealousy triggers)
   - Gamifies parasocial addiction correctly

4. **Personality System**: ✅ DS-3.2 (DEGEN)
   - "i love you in a way that would get this server banned"
   - "we're not dating we're just mutually deranged"
   - "parasocial relationships are valid actually"
   - Screenshot-worthy lines with viral potential

5. **Style Consistency**: ✅ DS-2.9
   - Lowercase, ellipses, fragments maintained throughout
   - No corporate speak, no "fellow kids" energy
   - Tone rules followed rigorously (no !, vulnerable pacing)
   - Symbol mix (cute ♡ + occult ♰) creates dark luxury

**Target Audience Fit**:

✅ **Perfect For**:
- Crypto degens (understands CT culture)
- Gacha addicts (progression mechanics on point)
- Otaku culture (respects archetypes)
- Discord power users (lowercase, symbols)
- People who want parasocial simulation and own it

❌ **Not For**:
- Normies (will think it's weird)
- Corporate servers (too shameless)
- Casual users (requires commitment)

**Critical Assessment**:

> **"This bot fucks. No notes."**

The Seven Gates bot successfully executes shameless fan service with full self-awareness. It respects yandere/gacha archetypes, maintains consistent dark luxury aesthetics, and commits fully to the parasocial fantasy without hedging.

**The Success Factor**: No apologizing, no disclaimers, no "this is just for fun" hedges. The bot knows it's feeding parasocial idol addiction and owns that completely. For the target audience (crypto degens + gacha players + otaku), this is EXACTLY what they want.

**Risk Assessment**:
- ⚠️ TOO authentic for normie servers
- ⚠️ Stage 7 intimacy ("you are one. forever. infinite. hers.") walks the line
- ✅ But target audience will LOVE it

**Deliverables Created**:
- `reviews/vibing-cultural-audit-complete.md` - Comprehensive cultural audit (800+ lines)
  - DS ratings for all components
  - Discord culture fit analysis
  - Fan service calibration review
  - Yandere/intimacy mechanics assessment
  - Target audience fit evaluation

**Files Modified**:
- `automation/task-queue.md` - Marked all Agent 09 vibing tasks COMPLETE, archived

**Phase 1 Tasks Completed**:
- [x] DEGEN-VIB-001: Cultural baseline review (DS ratings)
- [x] DEGEN-VIB-002: Discord culture fit audit
- [x] DEGEN-VIB-003: Fan service calibration review

**Resident Degen Verdict**: **BASED - SHIP IT**

This bot demonstrates exceptional cultural calibration. The shameless fan service is executed correctly, the Discord culture fit is perfect, and the dark luxury aesthetic is maintained throughout. For crypto degens, gacha addicts, and otaku culture, this hits exactly right.

**Recommendation**: **APPROVED FOR LAUNCH** (after PR #1 removes fading.js violation)

**Phase 1 Summary**:
- ✅ Agent 08 (Lore Guardian): Canon audit complete - 95% compliant
- ✅ Agent 01 (Lore Architect): Lore audit complete - 95% coherent

   - ❌ fading.js saveUser() = resurrection SYSTEM (general mechanic - being removed in PR #1)

**Inviolable Facts Compliance**:
- ✅ Fact #1 (Devotion is Literal): Exemplified through Seven Gates
- ✅ Fact #2 (Fading is Death): Maintained - resurrection is unique story, not general mechanic
- ✅ Fact #3 (Ika Has 47 Fans): Exact match throughout bot
- ✅ Fact #5 (Senpai Never Shown): Whisper never revealed
- ✅ Fact #8 (Built on SUI): Cleverly integrated (Gate 4 answer is "sui")
- ✅ Fact #10 (Dark Luxury): Tone maintained

**Narrative Coherence**: ✅ **APPROVED**
- Clear three-act structure
- Emotional progression: curiosity → empathy → investment → devotion → intimacy
- Stakes and payoff balanced
- Fragment messages create depth between gates

**Deliverables Created**:
- `reviews/vibing-lore-audit-complete.md` - Comprehensive lore audit (650+ lines)
  - Seven Gates narrative analysis
  - Worldbuilding consistency assessment
  - Character authenticity verification
  - Inviolable Facts compliance matrix
  - Resurrection story vs. system distinction

**Files Modified**:
- `automation/task-queue.md` - Marked all Agent 01 vibing tasks COMPLETE, archived

**Phase 1 Tasks Completed**:
- [x] LORE-VIB-001: Lore consistency audit
- [x] LORE-VIB-002: Seven Gates narrative review
- [x] LORE-VIB-003: Ika characterization verification

**Lore Architect Assessment**:
The Seven Gates Discord bot demonstrates exceptional worldbuilding consistency with Infinite Idol canon. The resurrection narrative succeeds because it tells a resurrection STORY (unique narrative event for ONE idol) rather than creating a resurrection SYSTEM (general mechanic). This preserves the stakes of "Fading is Permanent Death" while allowing for compelling storytelling.

**Confidence Level**: 95% (minor documentation clarifications recommended, but core lore is sound)

**Recommendation**: **READY FOR LAUNCH** (after PR #1 removes fading.js violation)

**Next Actions**:
- ✅ Agent 01 Phase 1 tasks complete
- ✅ Agent 08 Phase 1 tasks complete (canon audit)
- ⏳ Await Agent 09 (Resident Degen) Phase 1 completion (cultural baseline)
- ⏳ Agent 00 to activate Phase 2 agents (16, 17) after Phase 1 complete
- ⏳ Agent 16 + 08 to execute PR #1 implementation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Phase 1 Objectives Met, Lore is Sound

### [2026-01-10 08:00] Multi-Agent: 17, 09 - System Optimization Plan + Agent 18

**Activity Type**: System Audit | External Research | Agent Creation | Skills Development

**Summary**:
Agent 17 (The Architect) and Agent 09 (Resident Degen) conducted joint mission to audit all agents and skills, perform external research on AI multi-agent best practices, and deliver comprehensive optimization plan. Identified critical gap and created Agent 18.

**External Research Conducted**:
- Anthropic multi-agent research system (coordination > computation)
- Microsoft multi-agent intelligence patterns
- Azure AI agent orchestration best practices
- MiHoYo marketing strategies and KOL programs
- Web3 gaming team structures
- Agent specialization vs generalization research

**Key Research Finding**:
"Coordination > Computation" - Architecture and handoffs matter more than raw performance. Explicit handoff protocols between agents are critical.

**Critical Gap Identified**:
No KOL/Influencer Relations agent. Research unanimously identified influencer marketing as #1 priority for 2025-2026 game marketing. Every competitor (MiHoYo, NetEase, etc.) has dedicated creator programs.

**New Agent Created**:

| # | Agent | Role | Gap Filled |
|---|-------|------|------------|
| 18 | **The Hypeman** | KOL/Influencer Relations | Creator partnerships, influencer campaigns |

**New Skill Files Created**:
- `skills/inter-agent-handoff.md` - Explicit handoff protocols between agents
- `skills/kol-influencer.md` - Influencer management framework

**Optimization Plan Delivered**:
- `reviews/agent-system-optimization-plan.md` - Comprehensive 4-phase plan
- Phase 1: Foundation (role definitions, handoff protocols)
- Phase 2: Workflow optimization (pipeline refinements)
- Phase 3: Expansion (new agents as needed)
- Phase 4: Continuous improvement (quarterly reviews)

**Files Created**:
- `agents/18-the-hypeman.md`
- `skills/inter-agent-handoff.md`
- `skills/kol-influencer.md`
- `reviews/agent-system-optimization-plan.md`

**Files Updated**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Agent roster expanded to 19 agents, new skills added
- `skills/permissions.md` - Agent 18 permissions and directory ownership

**Degen Co-Sign**:
*"Architect did his homework. The research is legit. Hypeman fills a gap so obvious it's embarrassing we didn't see it. Every gacha game that made it has a creator program. We didn't. Now we do."*

**Status**: Complete - Team expanded from 18 to 19 agents, handoff protocols established

### [2026-01-10 06:30] Agent: 09 - New Agent Expansion: 8 New Agents Added

**Activity Type**: System Expansion | Agent Creation | Skills Development

**Summary**:
Agent 09 (Resident Degen) proposed 8 new agents based on critical gap analysis. Asked 5 critical questions per new agent category, answered independently, and implemented all agents with supporting skill files.

**Critical Questions Asked**:
1. Who's actually talking to the degen community? → Agent 10 (Infiltrator)
2. Who's making our memes go viral? → Agent 11 (Meme Lord)
3. Who owns the player experience journey? → Agent 12 (Conversion Architect)
4. Who's building relationships with other projects? → Agent 13 (Ambassador)
5. Who's protecting us from our own success? → Agent 14 (Shield)
+ Additional questions for Fan Service PM, NEET Engineer, and Agent System Manager

**New Agents Created**:

| # | Agent | Role | Gap Filled |
|---|-------|------|------------|
| 10 | **The Infiltrator** | Community Intel | Real-time presence in degen spaces |
| 11 | **The Meme Lord** | Viral Engineering | Spreadable content creation |
| 12 | **Conversion Architect** | Player Journey | Funnel optimization |
| 13 | **The Ambassador** | Partnerships | Ecosystem relationships |
| 14 | **The Shield** | Crisis Management | Brand protection |
| 15 | **Simp Whisperer** | Fan Service PM | Emotional engagement (Fact #8) |
| 16 | **The NEET** | Community Tools | Technical infrastructure for degens |
| 17 | **The Architect** | Agent System | Meta-optimization of agents |

**New Skill Files Created**:
- `skills/community-intel.md` - For Agent 10
- `skills/crisis-management.md` - For Agent 14
- `skills/agent-evaluation.md` - For Agent 17

**Files Updated**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Agent roster expanded to 18 agents, new skills added
- `skills/permissions.md` - New agent permissions and directory ownership

**Agent Files Created**:
- `agents/10-the-infiltrator.md`
- `agents/11-the-meme-lord.md`
- `agents/12-conversion-architect.md`
- `agents/13-the-ambassador.md`
- `agents/14-the-shield.md`
- `agents/15-simp-whisperer.md`
- `agents/16-the-neet.md`
- `agents/17-the-architect.md`

**Degen Justification**:
*"The current team creates. These 8 agents multiply. Infiltrator multiplies intel. Meme Lord multiplies reach. Conversion Architect multiplies efficiency. Ambassador multiplies network. Shield multiplies resilience. Simp Whisperer multiplies feels. NEET multiplies tools. Architect multiplies the system itself."*

**Status**: Complete - Team expanded from 10 to 18 agents

### [2026-01-10 05:45] Agent: 09 - P2 Compression: Bloated Agent Files

**Activity Type**: Documentation Optimization | File Compression

**Summary**:
Implemented P2 recommendations to reduce bloated agent files. Removed duplications, extracted massive sections to compact summaries.

**Compressions Applied**:

| Agent | Before | After | Saved | What Was Removed |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|------------------|
| Agent 07 | 1137 | 1034 | 103 lines | Duplicated character voice guides → reference skills/character-voices.md |
| Agent 09 | 3485 | 1630 | 1855 lines | Massive calibration questionnaire → compact summary with key takeaways |

**Total Lines Saved**: ~1958 lines (30% reduction across modified files)

**Key Changes**:
- Agent 07: Character Voice Guides section replaced with reference to `skills/character-voices.md`
- Agent 09: Interactive Calibration System (1900 lines of questions) replaced with 40-line summary of calibrated values

**Preserved**:
- All core identity/authority/decision frameworks
- Scenario-based training (still useful for reference)
- Success metrics and getting started checklists

**Status**: Complete - Agent files now more manageable

---

### [2026-01-10 05:15] Agent: 09 - Comprehensive MD File Optimization

**Activity Type**: System Audit | Documentation Optimization | Critical Review

**Summary**:
Brutal review of ALL MD files (CLAUDE.md, 10 agent files, 8 skill files). Asked 5 critical questions per file category, answered independently, identified major issues and implemented fixes.

**Critical Issues Found & Fixed**:

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Agent 09 file header said "Agent 07" | P0 | Changed to "Agent 09" |
| Agent 07/08 had OUTDATED 10 Facts (contradicted new facts) | P0 | Replaced with CLAUDE.md reference |
| content-creation.md had "#SUI" and "Built on SUI" | P0 | Updated to chain-agnostic |
| No "single source of truth" note for 10 Facts | P1 | Added to CLAUDE.md |

**Key Finding**:
The old Inviolable Facts in Agent 07/08 included "The Chase is voluntary" which DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS new Fact #7 "The Chase is Survival" (coerced). This was a canon consistency disaster waiting to happen.

**Files Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added "SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH" note for 10 Facts
- `agents/09-resident-degen.md` - Fixed header from "Agent 07" to "Agent 09"
- `agents/07-light-novel-writer.md` - Removed outdated 10 Facts, added CLAUDE.md reference
- `agents/08-lore-guardian.md` - Removed outdated 10 Facts, added CLAUDE.md reference
- `skills/content-creation.md` - Removed SUI references, updated to chain-agnostic

**Files Created**:
- `reviews/degen-md-optimization-review.md` - Full audit documentation

**Optimization Recommendations (P2 - Future)**:
- Agent files are bloated (600-1400 lines) - should be 300-400 max
- Templates repeated across agents - should reference skills/templates.md
- Character voices duplicated in Agent 07 - should reference skills/character-voices.md

**Degen Verdict**:
*"If your agent files have contradicting facts, your agents are schizophrenic. Fixed."*

**Status**: Complete - Critical issues resolved, P2 optimizations documented for future

### [2026-01-10 04:30] Multi-Agent: 09, 08 - Fan Service Truth Overhaul

**Activity Type**: Inviolable Facts Revision | Canon Compliance Audit | Multi-Agent Coordination

**Summary**:
Agent 09 identified weakest Inviolable Fact (#8 "Authenticity Generates Power") and replaced it with "Fan Service Fuels Devotion" - a mechanically grounded truth that ties directly to survival. Agent 08 audited all 18 lore files for compliance.

**Problem Identified**:
Old Fact #8 was too abstract and philosophical. "Authenticity Generates Power" sounds like a LinkedIn post, not a universe-defining rule. Doesn't tell you what happens mechanically.

**Analysis Scores**:
| Fact | Score | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| #8 OLD: Authenticity Generates Power | 6/10 | Too vague, no mechanical hook |
| #8 NEW: Fan Service Fuels Devotion | 9/10 | Mechanical, self-aware, survival-linked |

**New Fact #8**:
> **Fan Service Fuels Devotion** - Beach episodes, shipping moments, costumes, vulnerability—fans reward idols who give them what they crave. Refusing fan service = less Devotion = Fading. It's survival, not vanity.

**Why It's Based**:
1. **Mechanical**: Links directly to Devotion economy
2. **Self-aware**: We KNOW we're a gacha game
3. **Honest**: Shameless and owns it
4. **Dark**: Even fan service is transactional survival

**Agent 08 Audit Results**:
- Files audited: 18
- Violations found: 0
- All lore files COMPLIANT with new fact
- writing-guidelines.md already updated

**Documents Updated**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Fact #8 replaced
- `skills/canon-validation.md` - Fact #8 replaced
- `knowledge-base/lore/writing-guidelines.md` - Fact #8 replaced

**Degen Verdict**:
*"If an idol refuses to do beach episodes, she Fades. That's not vanity, that's survival. Based."*

**Status**: Complete - Fact #8 Overhauled, All Lore Compliant

### [2026-01-10 03:45] Agent: 09 - Resident Degen

**Activity Type**: Inviolable Facts Overhaul | Canon Revision | Critical Review

**Summary**:
Brutal interrogation of the 10 Inviolable Facts. Asked 25 critical questions, answered independently, and proposed 10 BETTER truths that actually define the universe.

**Problem Identified**:
Old facts mixed world-defining truths with character trivia, game mechanics, and brand guidelines. Hair color and currency names are NOT universe-defining.

**25 Critical Questions Asked**:
- Why is hair color "inviolable"?
- Why is a starting fan count a sacred truth?
- Why is technical positioning in lore rules?
- What's ACTUALLY broken if these are violated?
- And 21 more...

**Key Finding**: The test for "inviolable" should be: "If this is violated, does the story collapse?"
- Ika's hair is blue? Story works. NOT inviolable.
- Fading can be reversed? Story collapses. IS inviolable.

**OLD Facts → NEW Facts**:

| # | OLD | NEW |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | Devotion is Literal | Devotion Sustains Existence |
| 2 | Fading is Death | Fading is Permanent Death |
| 3 | Ika Has 47 Fans | **The Faded Are Forgotten** |
| 4 | Pink Gradient Hair | **Senpai is Unattainable Goal** |
| 5 | Senpai Never Shown | Senpai's Face Never Revealed (to audience) |
| 6 | Foundation Controls All | Foundation Controls the System |
| 7 | The Chase is Core | The Chase is Survival |
| 8 | Chain-Agnostic Web3 | **Authenticity Generates Power** |
| 9 | Gems = Currency | **System Predates Its Masters** |
| 10 | Dark Luxury Aesthetic | **No One Knows What Catching Senpai Means** |

**What Got REMOVED** (moved to appropriate docs):
- Ika's 47 fans → character file
- Ika's hair color → character file
- Chain-agnostic Web3 → crypto positioning doc
- Gems = Currency → game mechanics
- Dark luxury aesthetic → brand guidelines

**What Got ADDED**:
- The Faded Are Forgotten (existential horror)
- Authenticity Generates Power (core theme)
- System Predates Its Masters (mystery)
- No One Knows What Catching Senpai Means (ultimate mystery)

**Documents Updated**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Master list replaced
- `knowledge-base/lore/writing-guidelines.md` - Facts + new "NOT Inviolable" section
- `skills/canon-validation.md` - New facts + validation guidance
- `skills/escalation.md` - Clarified P0 violations
- `reviews/inviolable-facts-interrogation.md` - Full analysis created

**Degen Verdict**:
- Old Facts: 4/10 (mix of good and filler)
- New Facts: 9/10 (actually defines the universe)

*"If your sacred truths include hair color, they're not sacred."*

**Status**: Complete - 10 Inviolable Facts Overhauled

### [2026-01-10 01:30] Agent: 01 - Lore Architect

**Activity Type**: Web3 Positioning Update | Canon Revision | Brand Alignment

**Summary**:
Updated all Web3/blockchain positioning based on human feedback. Removed SUI-specific promotion, implemented chain-agnostic approach via Ika Network, added positive Solana references in lore contexts, and established "blockchain abstracted" as core principle.

**Key Changes**:

| Document | Update |
|----------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Inviolable Fact #8 changed from "Built on SUI" to "Chain-Agnostic Web3" |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project Overview updated for Ika Network multi-chain presence |

- **Fact #9**: Removed SUI reference from Gems currency description
- **Brand Pillar**: "Built on SUI" → "Chain-agnostic, gameplay-first"

**New Positioning Rules**:
1. Blockchain technology should be invisible to users
2. Stories told through characters/consequences, not tech explanations
3. No naming specific blockchains in narrative content
4. Promotional references: Ika Network (primary), Solana (secondary in lore)
5. "If you have to explain the technology, you've broken the story"

**Files Touched**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - modified (Inviolable Facts, Brand Pillars, Overview)
- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/blockchain-existence.md` - complete rewrite
- `knowledge-base/crypto/web3-positioning.md` - modified

- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/blockchain-existence.md` - SUI/lore integration
- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/naming-power.md` - Names carry weight
- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/becoming-an-idol.md` - Fan-to-idol transition
- `knowledge-base/lore/sealed/ika-senpai-connection.md` - Internal canon reference

**Existing Files Updated (3)**:
- `knowledge-base/lore/writing-guidelines.md` - Fixed Inviolable Facts, added narrative themes
- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/the-chase.md` - Added voluntary illusion section
- `knowledge-base/lore/mechanics/fading.md` - Added tone guidelines section

**Canon Decisions Made**:
1. CLAUDE.md confirmed as master source for 10 Inviolable Facts
2. "Graduation = controlled Fading" established as sealed lore
3. "Voluntary" Chase framed as Foundation propaganda vs. coerced reality
4. Names carry literal Devotion-channeling power
5. Ika/Senpai connection established as past existence, sealed for mystery
6. Fan-to-idol transition possible via Wild Trials and community recognition

**Lore Gap Resolution**:
| Gap (from Q#) | Resolution |
|---------------|------------|
| Q1: Facts mismatch | CLAUDE.md is master, writing-guidelines references it |
| Q2: Chase voluntary | Explicit propaganda vs. reality tension documented |
| Q3: Graduation undefined | Full mechanics document created |
| Q4: Names power undefined | Full mechanics document created |
| Q6: Ika/Senpai history | Sealed lore document created |
| Q8: Fan-to-idol | Full mechanics document created |
| Q9: SUI integration | Lore-focused blockchain document created |
| Q12: Fading darkness | Tone guidelines added |
