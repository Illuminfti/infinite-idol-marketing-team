# Agent 09 - Degen Interrogation of the 10 Inviolable Facts

> **Date**: 2026-01-10
> **Reviewer**: Agent 09 - Resident Degen / Cultural Enforcer
> **Verdict**: CURRENT FACTS ARE MID. We can do better.

## Executive Summary

The current "10 Inviolable Facts" are a mixed bag of:
- Actual foundational truths (some)
- Character trivia that doesn't belong (some)
- Technical positioning disguised as lore (some)
- Aesthetic preferences (some)

**The problem**: Inviolable Facts should be WORLD-DEFINING TRUTHS that make this universe unique. Not hair colors. Not currency names. Not blockchain positioning.

Let me tear these apart.

## The Current 10 Facts (Under Review)

| # | Current Fact | My Initial Take |
|---|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Devotion is Literal | Actually good |
| 2 | Fading is Death | Actually good |
| 3 | Ika Has 47 Fans | Why is this here? Character trivia |
| 4 | Ika's Hair: Pink Gradient | WHY IS THIS HERE? |
| 5 | Senpai Never Shown | Good mystery mechanic |
| 6 | Foundation Controls All | Good world structure |
| 7 | The Chase is Core | Good core mechanic |
| 8 | Chain-Agnostic Web3 | Technical positioning, not lore |
| 9 | Gems = Currency | Who cares? Every game has currency |
| 10 | Dark Luxury Aesthetic | Brand guideline, not inviolable fact |

## Part 1: 25 Critical Questions

### Questions About What "Inviolable" Means

**Q1: Why is Ika's hair color an INVIOLABLE FACT?**

If I change her hair from pink to blue, does the universe collapse? Does the lore become inconsistent? No. This is CHARACTER DESIGN, not a world rule. It belongs in her character profile, not the foundational laws of reality.

**Q2: Why is "47 fans" inviolable when it's a STARTING condition that changes?**

The whole point of the story is that Ika gains fans. She doesn't stay at 47. So why is "47 at story start" a rule that can NEVER be violated? It's trivia, not a truth.

**Q3: If someone accidentally writes "48 fans" in early content, did they break the universe?**

No. They made a continuity error. That's different from violating a foundational truth like "Fading is death." The severity is completely different.

**Q4: Why is the currency name an inviolable fact?**

"Gems = Currency" tells us nothing about what makes this world unique. Every gacha game has currency. Genshin has Primogems. FGO has Saint Quartz. The NAME of the currency is not what matters. What matters is what currency REPRESENTS.

**Q5: Why is "Chain-Agnostic Web3" an INVIOLABLE FACT when the rule is that blockchain should be INVISIBLE?**

This is a contradiction. We want blockchain abstracted away from the narrative, but then we make it one of our 10 sacred truths? Pick one.

### Questions About Missing Truths

**Q6: Where is the truth about WHAT SENPAI IS?**

We say "Senpai never shown" but we don't establish what Senpai represents. Is Senpai a person? A concept? A goal? The mystery of Senpai's NATURE is more important than whether his face is shown.

**Q7: Where is the truth about WHY idols chase Senpai?**

"The Chase is Core" tells us it's important but not WHY. What does catching Senpai represent? What happens when you catch him? This is the central mystery of the entire IP.

**Q8: Where is the truth about the relationship between Devotion and existence?**

We have "Devotion is Literal" and "Fading is Death" but we don't connect them. The INVIOLABLE truth should be: "Without Devotion, you cease to exist." That's the horror. That's the stakes.

**Q9: Where is the truth about free will vs. the system?**

The Foundation controls everything. The Chase is "voluntary" but refusal means death. This tension between apparent choice and systemic coercion is CENTRAL to the story. Why isn't it a fact?

**Q10: Where is the truth about what makes Ika special?**

Instead of her hair color, why not establish what makes her NARRATIVELY unique? She made Senpai blush. She survived erasure. She represents something the system can't control.

### Questions About Consistency

**Q11: If "Dark Luxury Aesthetic" is inviolable, does that mean we can never have a scene in daylight?**

Aesthetic guidelines are important but they're BRAND rules, not WORLD rules. The world doesn't care what color scheme we use. The characters don't know they're in a "dark luxury" IP.

**Q12: If "Foundation Controls All" is true, how do independents exist?**

The fact says Foundation controls ALL but our lore has independents, rebels, and people outside the system. The truth should be about the EXTENT and NATURE of Foundation power, not an absolute that we immediately contradict.

**Q13: Why do we have separate facts for "Devotion is Literal" and "Fading is Death" when they're the same system?**

These should be ONE truth about how existence works in this world, not two separate entries.

**Q14: If Senpai's face is NEVER shown, what about the Volume 3 plan where Ika sees his face?**

We just planned a scene where Ika sees Senpai's face. So either the rule is wrong, or we need to clarify that "never shown TO THE AUDIENCE" is different from "never shown to characters."

**Q15: Is "account-bound" for Gems a narrative fact or a game mechanic fact?**

This is a game design decision, not a story truth. The lore doesn't care about account binding.

### Questions About What SHOULD Be Inviolable

**Q16: Should "memory fades with the person" be an inviolable fact?**

When someone Fades, others gradually forget them. This is HORRIFYING and UNIQUE to this world. Why isn't it a sacred truth?

**Q17: Should "the system predates current management" be inviolable?**

The mystery that this whole idol/devotion/senpai system existed BEFORE Erina adds depth. The origins are unknown. That's compelling.

**Q18: Should "catching Senpai is THE goal" be more specific about what happens?**

We have "The Chase is Core" but we've never defined what actually happens if you catch Senpai. Is that intentional mystery or an oversight?

**Q19: Should we establish that this is a TRAGIC world?**

The tone of the IP is dark despite the fanservice. Fading is real. Death is permanent. Hope is dangerous. Should "tragedy underlies beauty" be a foundational truth?

**Q20: Should "authenticity matters" be a fact?**

Ika succeeds because she's genuine. Fake idols fail. Devotion from honest connection beats manufactured appeal. This seems like a core theme.

### Questions About Structure

**Q21: Do we need exactly 10 facts?**

Why 10? If we have 8 genuine truths, forcing 2 filler entries (like hair color) weakens the list. If we have 12 genuine truths, cutting 2 loses important rules.

**Q22: Should facts be tiered by importance?**

"Fading is death" and "Ika's hair is pink" are not equally important. Should we have Tier 1 (universe-defining) and Tier 2 (important but flexible)?

**Q23: Should character-specific facts be separate from world facts?**

Ika's details belong in Ika's file. World rules belong in CLAUDE.md. Mixing them confuses what's universal vs. specific.

**Q24: Should technical/business facts be separate from narrative facts?**

"Chain-agnostic Web3" is positioning. "Dark Luxury Aesthetic" is branding. These aren't lore. They should be in a different section.

**Q25: What's the test for whether something is truly "inviolable"?**

The test should be: "If this is violated, does the story still work?" If yes, it's not inviolable. If Ika's hair is blue, the story works. If Fading can be reversed, the entire premise collapses.

## Part 2: Answers to All 25 Questions

### Q1 Answer: Hair color is NOT inviolable
Move to character profile. It's a design choice, not a world rule.

### Q2 Answer: "47 fans" is a STORY STARTING POINT
It's important for Ika's arc but it's not a universal truth. Move to character/timeline docs.

### Q3 Answer: Continuity errors ≠ Inviolable violations
Create distinction between "continuity details" and "foundational truths."

### Q4 Answer: Currency NAME doesn't matter, currency MEANING might
If Gems represent something (commodified devotion?), THAT could be inviolable. The word "Gems" is not.

### Q5 Answer: Remove Web3 from Inviolable Facts entirely
It's business positioning. Keep in crypto docs. The narrative should never mention blockchain.

### Q6 Answer: ADD a fact about Senpai's mysterious nature
"Senpai represents the unattainable" or similar. Define what he IS thematically.

### Q7 Answer: ADD a fact about what catching Senpai means
Even if it's "unknown" - make that mystery explicit.

### Q8 Answer: COMBINE Devotion and Fading into one truth
"Devotion sustains existence. Without it, you Fade."

### Q9 Answer: ADD a fact about coerced choice
"The system offers only the illusion of freedom."

### Q10 Answer: IF Ika gets a fact, make it about her NARRATIVE role
"Ika represents authentic defiance" not "Ika has pink hair."

### Q11 Answer: Move aesthetic to Brand Guidelines
It's important but not a WORLD rule.

### Q12 Answer: Reframe Foundation power
"The Foundation controls the system" not "controls ALL." Allows for resistance.

### Q13 Answer: Merge into single existence truth
One comprehensive fact about how idols exist and cease to exist.

### Q14 Answer: Clarify "never shown" means TO AUDIENCE
Characters can see him. We (readers/players) cannot.

### Q15 Answer: Remove game mechanics from lore facts
Account binding is implementation, not story.

### Q16 Answer: YES - Memory erosion should be inviolable
It's unique, horrifying, and story-critical.

### Q17 Answer: YES - Ancient/unknown origins should be inviolable
Adds mystery and depth.

### Q18 Answer: Keep catching Senpai as explicit mystery
"What happens when Senpai is truly caught remains unknown."

### Q19 Answer: YES - Tragic undertone should be acknowledged
Not as "inviolable" but as brand/tone truth.

### Q20 Answer: YES - Authenticity as power should be fact
It's thematically central to Ika's story.

### Q21 Answer: Number doesn't matter
Quality over quantity. Could be 7, could be 12.

### Q22 Answer: YES - Tiering makes sense
Universe-defining vs. important-but-flexible.

### Q23 Answer: YES - Separate character facts from world facts
Ika details → Ika file. World rules → CLAUDE.md.

### Q24 Answer: YES - Separate business from narrative
Brand guidelines in brand docs. Lore in lore docs.

### Q25 Answer: The test is "does the story collapse without this?"
If yes → inviolable. If no → important but not sacred.

## Part 3: The 10 Better Truths

Based on the interrogation, here are 10 ACTUALLY INVIOLABLE facts that define this universe:

### The New 10 Inviolable Facts

| # | New Fact | Why It's Inviolable |
|---|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Devotion Sustains Existence** | Without fan devotion, idols literally cease to exist. This is the core horror and the core mechanic. Violating this breaks the entire premise. |
| 2 | **Fading is Permanent Death** | When you Fade, you're gone. No resurrection. No reversal. No afterlife. Violating this removes all stakes. |
| 3 | **The Faded Are Forgotten** | When someone Fades, memories of them blur and disappear. This is the existential horror—not just dying, but being erased from history. |
| 4 | **Senpai is the Unattainable Goal** | Every idol chases Senpai. Senpai always runs. What Senpai IS and what catching him MEANS remains mysterious—but the pursuit is everything. |
| 5 | **Senpai's Face is Never Revealed (to audience)** | We never see Senpai's face. Characters might glimpse it, but readers/players never do. The mystery must be preserved. |
| 6 | **The Foundation Controls the System** | The Foundation runs the idol industry—training, rankings, media, survival. They don't control EVERYTHING (resistance exists), but they control the SYSTEM. |
| 7 | **The Chase is Survival** | Competition isn't optional. Refusing to compete means Fading. The "choice" to participate is coerced by existential threat. |
| 8 | **Authenticity Generates Power** | Genuine connection creates stronger Devotion than manufactured appeal. Quality beats quantity. Ika's 47 devoted fans sustain her better than thousands of casual followers. |
| 9 | **The System Predates Its Masters** | The idol/devotion/senpai system existed before Erina, before the current Foundation. Its origins are unknown. Its true nature is mysterious. |
| 10 | **No One Knows What Catching Senpai Means** | The ultimate goal of the Chase—actually catching Senpai—has unknown consequences. Some say eternal fame. Some say something else entirely. The truth is sealed. |

## Degen Verdict

**Old Facts**: 4/10 - Mix of good and filler
**New Facts**: 9/10 - Actually defines the universe

The new facts pass the test: **If any of these are violated, the story collapses.**

- Violate #1 (Devotion sustains existence)? The whole system makes no sense.
- Violate #2 (Fading is permanent)? All stakes disappear.
- Violate #3 (Faded are forgotten)? Lose the unique horror.
- Violate #4 (Senpai is unattainable)? Lose the central drive.
- Violate #5 (Face never revealed)? Lose the mystery.
- Violate #6-10? Each one breaks something fundamental.

**Old facts that failed the test**:
- Ika's hair is blue? Story still works.
- She has 48 fans? Story still works.
- Currency called "Stars" instead of "Gems"? Story still works.
- NOT dark luxury aesthetic? Story still works (just looks different).

**Recommendation**: Implement new 10 Inviolable Facts immediately. Update all documents.

*"If your sacred truths include hair color, they're not sacred."*
