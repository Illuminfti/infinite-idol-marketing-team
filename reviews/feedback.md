## Notes for Sheran

### How to Leave Feedback

1. Copy the Feedback Template above
2. Fill in all fields - specific is better than vague
3. Be clear about whether action is required
4. Update the statistics tables if time permits

### Feedback Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: "The Ika tweet was too cutesy" vs "The content wasn't right"
- **Be Actionable**: Include what should be done differently
- **Be Timely**: Feedback is most useful soon after the event
- **Be Balanced**: Praise good work, not just corrections
