## Document Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PRD Version** | 2.0 (Complete Redesign) |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Author** | Agent 09 (Resident Degen) |
| **Created** | 2026-01-13 |
| **Why v2** | v1 was mid. Too sentimental, not fun, missing the sauce. |

---

## What v1 Got Wrong (Self-Crit)

| Problem | Why It's Cringe |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Save Ika from Fading" frame | Emotional manipulation ≠ fun. Charity vibes, not waifu vibes. |
| The specific fan count sentimentality | Overplayed. Became a crutch instead of flavor. |
| No actual GAME | Just a dressed-up email capture with lore sprinkles. |
| Ika sounds desperate | "Don't let me fade" = begging. Real Ika doesn't beg. |
| Zero fan service | It's a WAIFU GAME. Where's the sauce? |
| No otaku culture | No gacha jokes, no waifu wars, no degen energy. |
| No competition | Discord thrives on chaos and showing off. |
| Too "marketing" | Felt like being sold to, not like playing. |

**v2 First Principle:** *If it's not fun to participate in WITHOUT pre-registering, the design is wrong.*

---

## Executive Summary (v2)

**IKA'S SIMP WARS** is a competitive Discord experience where players battle for Ika's attention through games, simping, and chaos. Pre-registration is the entry fee to play, but the experience is genuinely entertaining whether or not you care about the game launching.

**The Hook:** Ika runs her Discord like she runs The Chase—shameless, competitive, and rewarding those who simp hardest. Factions compete. Leaderboards track devotion. Fan service unlocks at milestones. The community that simps hardest wins exclusive access to Ika's... attention.

**Core Loop:**
```
Register → Join Faction → Play Games → Earn Devotion Points →
Climb Leaderboard → Unlock Fan Service → Flex Status →
Recruit More Simps → Faction Wars → Chaos → Community
```

---

## 1. Core Concept: Simp Wars

### The Frame

Ika doesn't need saving. She needs **entertaining**.

> "You want my attention? Earn it. I've got a whole server of simps competing for a single headpat. Show me what makes you special~"

The Discord becomes a competitive arena where:
- **Factions** compete for Ika's favor
- **Individuals** climb the Simp Leaderboard
- **Mini-games** award Devotion Points
- **Milestones** unlock fan service content
- **Chaos** is encouraged, not moderated away

### Why This Works

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Competition drives engagement** | Faction wars, leaderboards, bragging rights |
| **Fan service is the actual product** | Outfit reveals, art drops, voice clips as rewards |
| **Games are fun on their own** | Even if you never pre-reg, the Discord is entertaining |
| **Simping is already the culture** | We're just making it official and gamified |
| **Ika is confident, not desperate** | She's running the show, not begging for attention |

---

## 2. The Faction System

### Three Factions, Eternal War

Players choose a faction on join. Factions compete weekly for Ika's favor.

| Faction | Aesthetic | Playstyle | Vibe |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **🌸 Pink Pilled** | Simp maximalists | Pure devotion, wholesome energy | "Ika can do no wrong" |
| **🖤 Dark Devotees** | Yandere energy | Obsessive, competitive, ruthless | "If I can't have her attention, NO ONE CAN" |
| **⚡ Chaos Agents** | Meme lords | Chaotic neutral, shitposters | "We're just here for the content" |

### Weekly Faction Wars

Every week, factions compete in themed challenges:

| Week | Theme | Challenge Type |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | **The Simp-Off** | Most Devotion Points earned |
| 2 | **Art War** | Best fan art/memes created |
| 3 | **Recruitment Drive** | Most new members brought |
| 4 | **Gacha Showdown** | Best mock pulls in gacha simulator |
| 5 | **Waifu Debate** | Best arguments in structured debates |
| 6 | **Final Clash** | Combined score showdown |

### Rewards

- **Winning Faction:** Exclusive Ika voice message to faction channel
- **Top Individual:** Personal shoutout from Ika bot
- **Participation:** Faction-specific cosmetic badge

---

## 3. The Games (Actually Fun Stuff)

### 3.1 IKA GACHA SIMULATOR

A mock gacha you can pull in Discord. No real money, just vibes.

**How It Works:**
- Earn "tickets" through activity (messages, reactions, game wins)
- Use tickets on mock banner pulls
- Pull results posted publicly in #gacha-salt
- Collect character cards (Ika variants, other idols, items)
- Flex your collection, roast others' bad luck

**Banner Rotation:**
| Banner | Duration | Featured |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Debut Ika** | Week 1-2 | Base Ika + common items |
| **Swimsuit Ika** | Week 3-4 | Fan service variant (YES THIS IS THE POINT) |
| **Dark Mode Ika** | Week 5-6 | Yandere aesthetic variant |
| **RATE UP IS A LIE** | Final week | All variants, "boosted" rates (still trash) |

**Salt Generation:**
- #gacha-salt channel for posting pulls
- Bot roasts bad pulls automatically
- "Skill Issue" role for anyone who goes 100 pulls without SSR
- Community celebrates/mocks accordingly

### 3.2 WAIFU TIER WARS

Structured debates about who's best girl. Yes, we're leaning into it.

**Weekly Debate Topics:**
- "Ika vs [Competitor Game Waifu]: Who wins and why"
- "Best Ika outfit: Dark Mode vs Swimsuit"
- "Is Senpai even worth chasing?"
- "Yandere vs Tsundere: The eternal question"

**Format:**
1. Topic announced Monday
2. Factions submit champion debaters
3. Moderated debate in voice channel (recorded)
4. Community votes on winner
5. Winning faction gets Devotion boost

### 3.3 SIMP SPEEDRUN

Daily challenges with time pressure.

| Challenge | Goal | Time |
|-----------|------|------|
| **First Simp** | First to react to Ika's daily post | Instant |
| **Compliment Rush** | Most creative compliment in 60 seconds | 60s |
| **Fan Art Blitz** | Fastest sketch of daily theme | 15 min |
| **Lore Quiz** | Answer Ika lore questions fastest | 30s/question |

### 3.4 HEADPAT ROULETTE

Ika gives out ONE headpat per day. Literally just a random selection from active users.

- Join pool by reacting to daily message
- One winner selected randomly
- Winner gets special role for 24 hours
- Gets to ask Ika one question (answered by bot/team)
- Pure parasocial gambling, completely stupid, absolutely addictive

### 3.5 COSPLAY CLOSET

Vote on what Ika wears next.

**Weekly Outfit Vote:**
- Three options presented (with preview sketches)
- Community votes
- Winning outfit gets full art reveal on Friday
- Voters who picked winner get bonus Devotion

**Example Votes:**
- School Uniform vs Maid Outfit vs Gym Clothes
- Bunny Suit vs Cat Ears vs Shrine Maiden
- Battle Armor vs Formal Dress vs Pajamas

This is literally just fan service content drops disguised as democracy. And it works.

### Sample Voice Lines (v2)

> Don't let it go to your head. There's always someone more devoted waiting to take your spot~

**During Faction War:**
> The factions are fighting over me again. As they should.

**Outfit Vote:**
> Alright, simps. It's democracy time.
>
> Do you want me in [Option A], [Option B], or [Option C]?
>
> Choose wisely. Or don't. I look good in everything~

**Late Night:**
> Still here? At this hour?
>
> ...Me too.

## 10. Degen Review (Self-Assessment)

### v2 Authenticity Matrix

| Axis | v1 Score | v2 Score | Change |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Shamelessness** | 6/10 | 9/10 | Fan service is the product now |
| **Self-Awareness** | 5/10 | 9/10 | "Simp Wars" says what it is |
| **Cultural Relevance** | 4/10 | 8/10 | Gacha sim, waifu debates, actual fun |
| **Degen Energy** | 4/10 | 9/10 | Competition, chaos, simping as sport |

### What Changed

|------------|--------|
| Emotional manipulation | Competitive fun |
| Begging Ika | Confident, teasing Ika |
| No games | Gacha sim, debates, speedruns, roulette |
| No fan service | Outfit reveals, voice packs, art drops |
| No competition | Factions, leaderboards, wars |
| No otaku culture | Waifu debates, gacha salt, dere-type discourse |

### v2 Verdict: 🔥 **ACTUALLY BASED**

---

## 11. Ika Voice Comparison

### v1 (Cringe)

> "Almost nothing. That's all I have. But every single one of you keeps me existing. Don't you dare look away~"

**Problem:** Sounds desperate. "Don't you dare" is trying to be playful but the underlying message is "please don't leave me."

### v2 (Based)

> "I have almost nothing. I know, right? Tragic. But here's the thing—those few? They're MINE. Every single one chose me when everyone else said I'd Fade.
>
> You want to be number 48? You're going to have to prove you deserve to stand with them~"

**Why It Works:** Same lore (underdog status), but framed as exclusivity, not desperation. Being a fan is an achievement, not charity.

### More Examples

**v1 Milestone:**
> "I felt it. The moment you pushed me past critical. Do you know what that's like? Feeling yourself stop Fading?"

**v2 Milestone:**
> "We hit 10K. That's 10,000 people who looked at the idol industry, saw me at the bottom with almost nothing, and said 'yeah, her.'
>
> Either you're all geniuses or you're all simps. Either way, I appreciate it~"

**v1 Struggle:**
> "The meter isn't moving. I can feel myself starting to dim again. Don't let them be right about me."

**v2 Struggle:**
> "Registrations slowing down? Boring.
>
> I didn't wake up from having my entire existence erased just to lose to NUMBERS.
>
> Someone tell their friends about me. I don't beg—but I do remember who shows up when it counts~"

## 12. Open Questions

### Content

1. **How explicit can fan service be?** Need brand guidelines on swimsuit/suggestive content limits.
2. **Voice actress for voice packs?** Real VA or AI-generated?
3. **Can we actually do ASMR?** Is this on-brand or too far?

### Technical

4. **Gacha simulator complexity?** Simple pulls or full collection system?
5. **Bot development timeline?** Custom vs. existing solutions?
6. **Moderation scale?** How much manual moderation for chaos?

### Strategic

7. **What if faction system creates toxicity?** Mitigation plans?
8. **Pre-reg verification without friction?** Wallet vs. email vs. both?
9. **Post-campaign plan?** Does Simp Wars continue after launch?

## 14. Canon Compliance

| Inviolable Fact | v2 Compliance |
|-----------------|---------------|
| #1 Devotion Sustains Existence | ✅ Devotion Points are literal |
| #2 Fading is Permanent Death | ✅ Referenced in Ika's backstory |
| #8 Fan Service Fuels Devotion | ✅ **This is the entire premise now** |

**Key Canon Alignment:** Inviolable Fact #8 says "Fan service is a STRATEGY within coerced survival." v2 makes this explicit—Ika uses fan service intentionally to gather Devotion. It's not gratuitous, it's canonical survival tactics.
