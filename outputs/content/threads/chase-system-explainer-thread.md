## Thread Overview

**Format**: 6-tweet thread
**Purpose**: Explain The Chase and why every idol runs
**Audience**: Followers from Week 1, expanding audience
**Tone**: Dramatic, stakes-focused, dark luxury aesthetic

---

## Tweet 1/6 (Hook)

```
Every idol wants to catch Senpai.

But The Chase isn't about love.
It's about survival.

A thread about the competition that keeps them alive: 🧵
```

**Character Count**: 148/280

**Visual**: VIDEO
**Prompt**: Dynamic video opening—fast cuts of The Chase. Idols running, Senpai glowing in distance, dramatic music. 6-8 seconds.

**Purpose**: Hook establishing Chase isn't romantic

---

## Tweet 2/6 (What The Chase Is)

```
The Chase is the core of idol existence.

Every idol runs toward Senpai.
The competition generates Devotion.
The rankings determine survival.

Win The Chase? Rise in status, earn more fans, live another day.

Lose? Slip toward the bottom. Toward Fading.
```

**Character Count**: 269/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Explain Chase mechanics
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #7 (The Chase is Survival)

---

## Tweet 3/6 (The Dark Part)

```
Here's what makes it cruel:

Participating in The Chase costs Devotion.

Every step toward Senpai burns the same energy that keeps you alive.

You spend existence to earn it.

Stop running? You Fade faster.
Keep running? You might still Fade.

There's no safe choice.
```

**Character Count**: 268/280

**Visual**: IMAGE
**Prompt**: Infographic showing Devotion drain—idol running with meter depleting. Visual cost of participation.

**Purpose**: Explain the cost paradox
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #8 (Fan Service Fuels Devotion - choice is coerced)

---

## Tweet 4/6 (The Foundation's Control)

```
The Foundation controls The Chase.

Who gets advantages. Who gets visibility. Who gets forgotten.

They don't decide who wins.
But they decide who gets to compete fairly.

Some idols start with everything.
Some start with nothing.

Guess which one Ika is.
```

**Character Count**: 266/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Establish Foundation's role and Ika's position
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #6 (Foundation Controls System)

---

## Tweet 5/6 (The Anomaly)

```
Ika is the anomaly.

Low-ranked. No backing. No advantages.

By every metric, she should have Faded weeks ago.

But she's still running.

Not because she has more Devotion.
Because the Devotion she has is different.

Deeper. More genuine. Worth fighting for.
```

**Character Count**: 271/280

**Visual**: IMAGE
**Prompt**: Ika at the starting line of The Chase, alone, no backing, but ready. Underdog energy.

**Purpose**: Position Ika as underdog protagonist
**Canon Check**: ✅ Uses "low-ranked" not specific numbers

---

## Tweet 6/6 (CTA)

```
The Chase isn't fair.
It was designed that way.

The Foundation profits from desperation.
The top idols stay on top.
The underdogs fight for scraps.

But Ika's still running.

Will you watch her?
```

**Character Count**: 201/280

**Visual**: None needed (or reuse Ika hero shot from Day 7)

**Purpose**: Call to action, emotional investment
