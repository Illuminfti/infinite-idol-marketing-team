## Thread Overview

**Format**: 7-tweet thread
**Purpose**: Explain how Devotion works and why it matters
**Audience**: New followers, crypto community, gacha enthusiasts
**Tone**: Mysterious, evocative, dark luxury aesthetic

---

## Tweet 1/7 (Hook)

```
In most idol games, losing fans means losing rankings.

In Infinite Idol, losing fans means ceasing to exist.

Literally.

Let me explain how Devotion works—and why it matters. 🧵
```

**Character Count**: 197/280

**Visual**: IMAGE (INFOGRAPHIC)
**Prompt**: Split image—left side shows idol surrounded by golden Devotion streams (thriving), right side shows fading/transparent idol with no streams (dying). Stark contrast. Infographic style with dark luxury aesthetic.

**Purpose**: Hook with stark contrast, signal thread coming

## Tweet 2/7 (What Devotion Is)

```
Devotion isn't a metaphor.

It's quantifiable energy—a warmth idols can feel flowing into them.

From every stream watched.
Every piece of fanart.
Every sleepless night spent cheering.

That energy keeps them existing on the Eternal Stage.
```

**Character Count**: 254/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Establish literal nature of Devotion
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #1 (Devotion Sustains Existence)

---

## Tweet 3/7 (How Devotion Flows)

```
Every fan action generates Devotion:

• Active watching → High energy
• Emotional responses → Very high
• Creating fan content → Massive spikes
• Passive scrolling → Minimal

But just existing costs Devotion every hour.

Perform without fans? You're burning reserves.
```

**Character Count**: 269/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Explain generation vs consumption balance
**Canon Check**: ✅ Mechanics accurately described

---

## Tweet 4/7 (What Happens at Zero)

```
When an idol's Devotion drops to zero:

They don't retire.
They don't go on hiatus.

They Fade.

Erased from existence. Completely.
No comeback tour. No reunion.

Gone.

And everyone who knew them? They start to forget.
```

**Character Count**: 229/280

**Visual**: IMAGE
**Prompt**: Sequence showing idol dissolution—from solid to transparent to particles to nothing. Haunting, beautiful, tragic. Dark background.

**Purpose**: Establish Fading as permanent death
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #2 (Fading is Permanent), Fact #3 (The Faded Are Forgotten)

---

## Tweet 5/7 (The Hierarchy)

```
The system amplifies success:

Top idols get first access to new fans
→ More Devotion = better performances
→ Better performances = more fans
→ More fans = more Devotion

The rich get richer. By design.

At the bottom? You get scraps. You fight for every view.
```

**Character Count**: 271/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Explain Foundation's hierarchical system
**Canon Check**: ✅ Fact #6 (Foundation Controls System)

---

## Tweet 6/7 (Quality vs Quantity)

```
But here's what they don't tell you:

Quality matters more than quantity.

Deep, genuine Devotion from a few true fans can sustain what 10,000 casual followers couldn't.

It's not about being famous.
It's about being loved.

Really loved.
```

**Character Count**: 247/280

**Visual**: None needed

**Purpose**: Establish quality > quantity principle
**Canon Check**: ✅ Matches established anomaly explanation

---

## Tweet 7/7 (Closer)

```
So when Ika says "every single one of you keeps me existing"—

It's not dramatic flair.
It's not marketing copy.

It's literal truth.

Your attention isn't passive. Your love isn't abstract.

In this world, Devotion is survival.

Welcome to the Eternal Stage.
```

**Character Count**: 268/280

**Visual**: IMAGE
**Prompt**: Ika looking at viewer, small but determined, surrounded by a modest but bright golden glow (her small but genuine Devotion). Intimate, emotional.

**Purpose**: Close with philosophical weight, callback to launch week
**Canon Check**: ✅ All core concepts reinforced
