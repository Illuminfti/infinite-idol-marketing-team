### Visual Pairing (Optional)

**If Asset Coordinator provides visuals:**

- Tweet 3: No image (text-only for intimacy)
- Tweet 4: No image (let words land)
- Tweet 5: Ika + Sora silhouettes (competitive energy)
- Tweet 6: Ika looking up/forward (yearning visual)

**Recommendation**: Most of these work better as text-only for intimacy.
