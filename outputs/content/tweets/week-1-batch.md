## Day 1 (Launch)

### TWEET-W1-001: The Foundation
**Time**: 9:00 AM
**Pillar**: Lore Drop
**Voice**: Brand
**DS**: 3

```
Some idols have millions of fans.
Some have thousands.

She woke up with almost nothing.

That should be a death sentence.

Should be.
```

**Character Count**: 138/280

**Visual**: IMAGE
**Prompt**: Dark, atmospheric image. Black background with faint golden particles (Devotion energy) swirling. A single silhouette of a female figure in the distance, small but standing. No face visible. Text overlay not needed—let the mystery breathe. Dark luxury aesthetic, cinematic 16:9 ratio.

**Why it works**: Creates immediate intrigue without naming Ika. "Death sentence" references Fading without explaining it. "Should be" implies survival against odds. Cryptic, shareable, discussion-provoking.

**Canon Check**: ✅ No Inviolable Facts violated. References Fading implicitly.
**Restrictions Check**: ✅ No specific fan counts, no price action, no SUI promotion.
