# ♰ VIBING REPO OVERHAUL: MASTER PLAN ♰

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Coordinated By:** Agent 00 (Coordinator)
**Target Repo:** https://github.com/Illuminfti/vibing

---

## Executive Summary

The **Seven Gates Discord Bot** (vibing repo) is the primary community engagement experience for Infinite Idol. It's where fans directly interact with Ika, progress through ritualistic gates, and develop parasocial relationships with our fading idol.

This document coordinates a **full multi-agent overhaul** to optimize the experience for maximum community engagement, degen energy, and emotional impact.

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists

| Component | Files | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 7 Gate Progression | `src/gates/`, `src/commands/` | Functional |
| Ika AI Personality | `src/ika/` (40+ files) | Sophisticated |
| Mood System | `moods.js`, `moments.js` | Active |
| Jealousy/Yandere | `jealousy.js`, `yandere.js` | Implemented |
| Romance Engine | `romance.js`, `intimacy.js` | Deep |
| Shrine/Devotion | `shrine.js`, `trials.js` | Complete |
| Rare Events | `rareEvents.js`, `secrets.js` | Hidden content |
| Collective Rituals | `collective.js`, `rituals.js` | Group mechanics |
| Betrayal System | `betrayal.js`, `consequences.js` | Dark paths |

| 3AM Girlfriend Mode | `timeSecrets.js`, `vulnerability.js` | Time-gated |
| UI System | `src/ui/` | Phase 2 complete |

### Identified Gaps (Pre-Analysis)

1. **Viral Moment Engineering** - Missing optimized screenshot-worthy triggers
2. **Onboarding Conversion** - Gate 1→2 drop-off rate unknown
3. **Cultural Currency** - Meme potential underutilized
4. **Community Compounding** - Ritual participation unclear
5. **Degen Energy Calibration** - Voice authenticity needs audit
