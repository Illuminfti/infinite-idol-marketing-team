## Workflow

1. **Drafts go here first** - Agents create content in their designated directories
2. **Review cycle** - Content moves to `reviews/pending-human-review.md` if needed
3. **Approval** - Coordinator logs approved content in `reviews/approved.md`
4. **Publication** - Content Strategist schedules via `calendar/master-calendar.md`

---

## Quality Standards

All content in this directory must adhere to:

- **Dark luxury aesthetic** - Black and gold, premium feel
- **Canon compliance** - Verified against `knowledge-base/lore/`
- **Brand voice** - Per `knowledge-base/brand/voice-and-tone.md`
- **Ika consistency** - Pink gradient hair, 47 fans, shameless personality

## .gitkeep Files

Empty directories contain `.gitkeep` files to preserve structure. These should remain until actual content is added.
