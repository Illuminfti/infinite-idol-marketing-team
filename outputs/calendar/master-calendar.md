## Notes

### Strategic Reminders

- **Dark luxury, not pink cutesy** - All content must reflect our brand positioning
- **Ika is our voice** - 40% of content should be in her shameless, genuine voice
- **Gameplay over tokenomics** - We're a great game that uses blockchain, not a "crypto game"
- **47 fans is powerful** - Ika's underdog status is our strongest emotional hook

### Coordination Notes

- Content Strategist has primary responsibility for content creation
- Lore Architect must review all lore-adjacent content for canon compliance
- Asset Coordinator should be notified 48 hours before visual/audio assets needed
- Community Manager has autonomy for real-time engagement but logs significant interactions
