| **Ika Voice** | Shameless, not desperate | Confidence without try-hard energy |
| **Lore Tone** | Existential, not edgelord | Stakes are real, not performative darkness |
| **Crypto Refs** | Natural, not forced | We're on SUI but not shilling |
| **Gacha Refs** | Self-aware, not preachy | We know what gacha is |
| **Anime Energy** | Fresh refs only | No "Notice me senpai" jokes (ironic Senpai usage OK) |

## Strategic Reminders

- **Dark luxury, not pink cutesy** - All content must reflect our brand positioning
- **Ika is our voice** - 40% of content should be in her shameless, genuine voice
- **Gameplay over tokenomics** - We're a great game that uses blockchain, not a "crypto game"
- **47 fans is powerful** - Ika's underdog status is our strongest emotional hook
- **Agent 09 has cultural veto** - If it's cringe, it doesn't ship
