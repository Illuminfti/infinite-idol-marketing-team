## Content Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**NEVER include in any content:**

| Restricted | Why | Alternative |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| **"47 fans" as anchor** | Not core lore, too specific | "low-ranked", "underdog", "struggling idol" |
| **Price action/token price** | Not our focus | Game, lore, community |
| **SUI blockchain promotion** | No tech shilling | Gameplay first, blockchain invisible |
| **Chain comparisons** | No tech superiority | Gameplay first |
| **Specific fan counts** | Numbers don't anchor | Devotion system framing |

---

## Key Tweets Analysis

### Tweet 1: The Foundation (Day 1, 9AM)

```
Some idols have millions of fans.
Some have thousands.

She woke up with almost nothing.

That should be a death sentence.

Should be.
```

**Why it works:**
- Creates immediate intrigue without naming Ika
- "Death sentence" references Fading without explaining
- "Should be" implies survival against odds
- Cryptic, shareable, discussion-provoking

---

### Thread 1: Devotion System (Day 7)

7 tweets explaining:
1. Hook - "In most idol games, losing fans means rankings..."
2. What Devotion is (quantifiable energy)
3. How Devotion flows (generation vs consumption)
4. What happens at zero (Fading - permanent death)
5. The hierarchy (system favors top idols)
6. Quality vs quantity (genuine > casual)
7. Closer - "Devotion is survival"

---

### Thread 2: The Chase (Day 10)

6 tweets explaining:
1. Hook - "The Chase isn't about love..."
2. What The Chase is (competition toward Senpai)
3. The cost (running burns Devotion)
4. Foundation control (who gets advantages)
5. The anomaly (Ika's situation)
6. CTA - "Will you watch her?"

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Reply Timing
- Fan art/content: Within 1 hour (quote tweet with Ika gratitude)
- Questions: Within 2 hours (cryptic but helpful)
- Trending topics: Within 30 minutes (CT Express tier)

### Target Engagement
- Quote tweet replies that extend the mystery
- Community questions about lore
- "I'll be fan #X" type engagement
- Speculation about what catching Senpai means
