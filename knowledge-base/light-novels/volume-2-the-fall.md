## Characters Featured

| Character | Role in Volume 2 |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Runa** | Protagonist—builder of the network, sole survivor |
| **The Twelve** | Network members—each should be named and characterized |
| **Erina** | Antagonist—watches from above, acts when convenient |
| **The Foundation** | Institutional antagonist—exploits the tragedy |

### The Twelve (To Be Named)

The twelve idols who Faded in the network collapse should each have:
- A name and brief personality
- A reason they joined the network
- A memorable moment before the Fall
- Their Fading scene

This makes the tragedy personal, not abstract.

## Tone and Voice

When writing Volume 2 content, maintain:

- **Tragedy, not melodrama**: The deaths matter, don't cheapen them
- **Runa's guilt**: She built it, she feels responsible
- **Systemic critique**: The Foundation's structure made this possible
- **Dark luxury aesthetic**: Even in tragedy, maintain the premium tone
- **Hope before fall**: Show what they were fighting for

2. **Runa's trauma**: Explains her current character state in Volume 1 timeline
3. **The Foundation's power**: They didn't cause the collapse but exploited it perfectly
4. **Fading as horror**: Showing twelve Fadings makes the stakes viscerally real
5. **Why idols comply**: Fear of being the next cautionary tale
