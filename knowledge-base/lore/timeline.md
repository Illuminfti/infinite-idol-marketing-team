# Timeline - Chronological Events of the Infinite Idol Universe

> *"History is written by those who remain. The rest... Fade."*

---

## Overview

The history of the Infinite Idol universe spans from the discovery of Devotion to the present-day tournament. This timeline documents the major eras, pivotal moments, and key events that shaped the world as it exists today.

**Note**: Exact dates are deliberately obscured in the lore. Events are measured relative to significant milestones rather than calendar years.

---

## Era 1: The Age of Discovery

### The First Awakening

**When**: Time immemorial
**What**: The phenomenon of Devotion is first observed.

Someone—name lost to history—discovers that intense emotional investment from audiences creates tangible energy. This is the birth of Devotion as a force.

- Performances begin generating power
- The first proto-idols emerge naturally
- No formal structure yet exists

### The First Fading

**When**: Shortly after the First Awakening
**What**: The first idol Fades, establishing the existential stakes.

An early performer, once beloved, loses their audience. They begin to dim, flicker, and eventually cease to exist entirely. This horrifying event establishes the fundamental rule: **popularity isn't vanity—it's survival**.

## Era 2: The Age of Himeko

### The Rise of Himeko Ichiban

**When**: The Founding Era
**What**: Himeko Ichiban becomes the First Idol and revolutionizes everything.

Himeko Ichiban didn't just become an idol—she **defined** what an idol could be. She was the first to truly understand and harness Devotion deliberately.

Key achievements:
- Proved that Devotion could be cultivated strategically
- Demonstrated that audiences could be captivated through pursuit, not just performance
- Created an entirely new format of competition

### The Invention of The Chase

**When**: The Founding Era
**What**: Himeko creates The Chase format, transforming idol competition forever.

Himeko's revolutionary insight:

> *"The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting."*

She understood that the moment before the catch—the fingertips brushing fabric, the desperate lunge—generates more Devotion than success itself. She invented The Chase as a format where idols pursue Senpai across obstacle courses, creating perpetual tension.

This format becomes:
- The primary competition structure for all idols
- The backbone of the tournament system
- The most efficient Devotion-generation method known

### Himeko's Ascension

**When**: After establishing The Chase
**What**: Himeko achieves Eternal Fame and becomes the ultimate Senpai.

Rather than continue competing, Himeko transcended the system she created. She became the eternal object of pursuit—worshipped, desired, but never caught. She made herself the ultimate Senpai figure.

## Era 3: The Age of The Foundation

### Erina Builds the System

**When**: The Modern Era
**What**: Erina creates the modern idol infrastructure.

Seeing the chaos of unstructured idol competition, Erina built:

- **Training academies**: Standardized education for aspiring idols
- **Management agencies**: Professional structure for idol careers
- **Ranking systems**: Formal hierarchies based on performance
- **Media networks**: Controlled channels for Devotion generation
- **The Foundation itself**: The governing body of the entire industry

Erina's philosophy:

> *"Raw talent is nothing without proper training. Discipline creates champions."*

### The Foundation Takes Control

**When**: The Modern Era
**What**: The Foundation becomes the dominant power in the idol industry.

Under Erina's leadership, The Foundation establishes:
- Control over tournament entry and qualification
- Standards for official idol recognition
- Systems for Devotion distribution (favoring the elite)
- Mechanisms for identifying and addressing "problems"

The system concentrates power at the top. The rich get richer. The popular become more popular. Those at the bottom must fight for scraps or face oblivion.

### The Eternal Stage Emerges

**When**: The Modern Era
**What**: The Eternal Stage becomes the primary venue for all major competition.

Whether always there or constructed by The Foundation, the Eternal Stage becomes the arena where fates are decided. Its characteristics:
- Ever-shifting configuration for each Chase event
- Charged atmosphere of concentrated Devotion
- Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays
- Massive enough for thousands, intimate enough to feel every watching eye

## Era 4: The Rise of Legends

### Sora's Record-Breaking Season

**When**: Recent past
**What**: Sora achieves the most Senpai catches in a single season.

The purple-teal haired speedster shatters records:
- Fastest idol in three generations
- Most catches in a single season
- Also most falls, crashes, and "technical difficulties"

Sora proves that raw speed and relentless determination can compete with trained perfection—at a cost. Her body bears the evidence of her approach.

### Suiren's Technical Perfection

**When**: Recent past
**What**: Suiren establishes herself as the technically flawless prodigy.

Blue-teal haired and cool-eyed, Suiren makes impossible courses look effortless. Her technique is studied, replicated (unsuccessfully), and admired.

Her tragedy: everyone admires the technique, no one sees the person.

### The Network Experiment (Runa)

**When**: Before present day
**What**: Runa attempts to build a revolutionary fan-sharing network.

Runa, a systems-minded idol, creates an innovative approach:
- A network of 12 idols sharing fans and Devotion
- Meant to provide safety through collective support
- A direct challenge to The Foundation's hierarchy

---

## Era 5: The Present Day

### The Network Collapse

**When**: Recent past (Volume 2 timeline)
**What**: Runa's network fails catastrophically.

The system Runa built... collapses. The consequences are devastating:
- **12 idols Fade** when the shared Devotion system fails
- Runa survives but carries the weight of their loss
- The Foundation capitalizes on the tragedy
- The event serves as a warning against challenging the established order

This becomes a cautionary tale: innovation is dangerous when existence hangs in the balance.

### Ika's Mysterious Awakening

**When**: Present day (Volume 1 timeline)
**What**: Ika Minami wakes with no memories outside the tournament.

A girl wakes on cold, wet concrete with:
- No memories of her past
- Pink gradient hair (rose roots to magenta tips)
- Exactly **47 fans**—a dangerously low number
- An instinctive understanding of who she is

Someone tried to erase her. The memory wipe failed. They'll likely try again.

### Ika's Qualification

**When**: Present day
**What**: Ika crashes a public Chase qualifier and forces her way in.

With zero backing, maximum confidence, and raw talent, Ika qualifies for the tournament through unofficial channels. She makes the establishment choke.

Key moments:
- Crashes a public qualifier with no invitation
- Demonstrates undeniable skill
- **Makes Senpai blush**—an unprecedented event still being processed
- Forces The Foundation to acknowledge an outsider

### The Current Tournament

**When**: Present day
**What**: The Infinite Idol Tournament is underway.

The current tournament proceeds through its phases:

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Wild Trials** | Completed | Ika qualified through chaos |
| **Specialized Trials** | In Progress | Pursuit, Endurance, Performance, Chaos, Fusion |
| **Eternal Bout** | Upcoming | Final format TBD by the Stage |

The tournament concentrates so much energy that:
- Winners achieve Eternal Fame (permanent legend status)
- Losers face accelerated Fading
- The stakes have never been higher

## The Conflicts in Motion

### Philosophical Battle

The fundamental clash is underway:

| Erina (The Foundation) | vs | Ika (The Outsider) |
|------------------------|----|--------------------|
| Trained | | Raw |
| Controlled | | Shameless |
| Proper | | Real |
| System | | Disruption |

*Can authentic chaos beat refined perfection?*

### The Mystery

Unresolved questions hanging over the present:
- Who tried to erase Ika?
- Why target her specifically?
- What happens if they try again?
- What does The Foundation know?

---

## Future Events (Speculation)

The following are anticipated but not yet canon:

### The Eternal Bout

The final challenge will adapt to the competitors. The Stage itself will choose the format designed to create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.

### Potential Outcomes

- Ika achieves Eternal Fame through sheer authenticity
- The Foundation's grip tightens or breaks
- The mystery of Ika's erasure is revealed
- More idols may Face or be saved
