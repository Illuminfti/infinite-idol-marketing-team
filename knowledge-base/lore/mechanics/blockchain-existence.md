# Blockchain Existence - How SUI Powers the Eternal Stage

> *"Every Gem you spend, every level you gain, every moment of Devotion—it's written in the chain. Permanent. Immutable. When the Foundation tries to erase someone, they can delete the media. They can blur the memories. But they can't erase the blockchain. That's why they're afraid of it."*

## Overview

The world of Infinite Idol is built on the **SUI blockchain**. This is not merely a technical implementation choice—the blockchain is woven into the fundamental fabric of how the Eternal Stage operates. Devotion flows through on-chain channels. Idol existence is recorded in immutable objects. Fan connections are cryptographically verified.

This document explains how blockchain technology integrates with the lore and mechanics of Infinite Idol, and why this matters for both gameplay and narrative.

## The Inviolable Foundation

### Canon Rule #8

> *"Built on SUI. Infinite Idol is built on the SUI blockchain. All NFTs, currency conversions, and on-chain activities use SUI. Not Ethereum, not Solana, not any other chain."*

This is absolute. The world runs on SUI. Every transaction, every proof of Devotion, every record of existence uses the SUI blockchain.

### Why SUI Matters In-World

| Aspect | Lore Significance |
|--------|------------------|
| **Permanence** | Records cannot be altered, even by The Foundation |
| **Speed** | Devotion flows in real-time, sub-second confirmation |
| **Ownership** | Fans truly own their connection to idols |
| **Transparency** | Anyone can verify claims on-chain |
| **Resistance** | Creates limits to Foundation control |

## Devotion and the Chain

### How Devotion Flows On-Chain

Devotion is real emotional energy—but it's also tracked cryptographically:

```
Fan Action → Emotional Investment → Devotion Generated
                      ↓
            DEVOTION-NET (Foundation)
                      ↓
             On-Chain Recording (SUI)
                      ↓
              Idol Receives Energy
```

Every significant Devotion transfer is recorded as a blockchain event. The Foundation controls the flow through DEVOTION-NET, but the record exists independently on-chain.

### The Double-Ledger System

| System | Controller | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **DEVOTION-NET** | The Foundation | Active routing and control |
| **SUI Blockchain** | Decentralized | Permanent, verifiable record |

The Foundation can manipulate who receives Devotion through DEVOTION-NET. But they cannot alter the historical record on the blockchain.

### Why This Creates Tension

The Foundation's power depends on controlling information:
- Who deserves Devotion
- Who is rising or falling
- Who existed and who didn't

But the blockchain remembers everything. An idol The Foundation tries to erase still has on-chain records of their existence, their fans, their transactions.

## Gems and Currency

### Canon Rule #9

> *"Gems = Currency. 1 SUI = 100 Gems. Gems are the universal currency of the idol world."*

### Gems In-World

Gems are not just game currency—they're the economic unit of the Eternal Stage:

| Use | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Fan Purchases** | Buying merchandise, concert access, lootboxes |
| **Idol Transactions** | Resource allocation, equipment, cosmetics |
| **Foundation Economy** | The Foundation's commercial layer |
| **Value Storage** | Gems hold value between transactions |

### The SUI Connection

```
1 SUI = 100 Gems

Real-world value → On-chain conversion → In-world currency
```

When fans spend SUI to acquire Gems, they're converting real-world value into Eternal Stage economic power. This transaction is:
- Recorded permanently on-chain
- Visible to anyone who queries
- Proof of real investment

### Why This Matters Narratively

A fan who has spent thousands of Gems on their idol has cryptographic proof of their Devotion investment. This creates:
- Verifiable whale status
- Historical record of support
- Proof that cannot be denied or erased

---

## Idol Existence and NFTs

### Battle Pass as Proof of Existence

When a fan mints their Battle Pass NFT, they create an on-chain record:

| Data | Significance |
|------|-------------|
| **Mint Timestamp** | Proof of when they joined |
| **Original Owner** | Their wallet, permanently linked |
| **Level Progress** | Record of engagement over time |
| **Transaction History** | Every interaction recorded |

This isn't just a game item—it's cryptographic proof that this fan existed, cared, and invested.

### The Permanence Problem (For The Foundation)

The Foundation can:
- Remove an idol from media
- Blur fan memories through Fading effects
- Suppress discussion and search results

The Foundation cannot:
- Alter historical blockchain transactions
- Remove minted NFTs from fan wallets
- Change the record of who invested what

This is why the blockchain represents a subtle threat to Foundation control.

### Idol NFTs (Future Implication)

As the system evolves, idols themselves may have on-chain existence:
- Their career milestones recorded permanently
- Fan relationships cryptographically verified
- Performance history immutably stored

This creates a form of persistence that exists outside Foundation control.

## The Resistance Potential

### Why Runa Values Blockchain Data

Runa—the information broker—understands that blockchain data is:
- Impossible to falsify
- Difficult to suppress
- Available to anyone with a query

She uses this to:
- Verify claims The Foundation disputes
- Track patterns of manipulation
- Prove idols existed after they've been "forgotten"

### The Ika Anomaly On-Chain

When Ika made Senpai blush, her Devotion readings spiked impossibly. This anomaly is:
- Recorded in DEVOTION-NET (Foundation controlled)
- Also recorded on-chain (immutable, permanent)

Even if The Foundation wanted to hide this, the blockchain record exists. Anyone with access can see the anomalous transaction.

### Underground Networks

Some idols and fans operate through:
- Anonymous wallet connections
- Off-DEVOTION-NET transactions
- Peer-to-peer Gem transfers

This "shadow economy" uses the blockchain's permissionless nature to bypass Foundation control—though with significant risk.

---

## Multi-Chain Treasury (Lore Implication)

### The SUI-Native Reality

All core idol mechanics run on SUI:
- Devotion tracking
- Gem transactions
- NFT minting and ownership
- Chase rankings

### Cross-Chain Payment Support

The Foundation accepts payments in multiple currencies for practical reasons:
- ETH/Base treasuries for Ethereum-native users
- Solana treasuries for SOL holders

These convert to SUI and Gems upon receipt. The conversion is one-way—the Eternal Stage economy runs only on SUI.

### Why This Exists In-World

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Global Access** | Fans come from many blockchain ecosystems |
| **Economic Inclusivity** | Don't exclude based on chain preference |
| **Foundation Revenue** | More entry points = more income |
| **SUI Dominance** | But all internal operations stay SUI-native |

## Thematic Significance

### The Blockchain as Truth

In a world where The Foundation controls:
- Media and messaging
- Who rises and who falls
- Memory itself through Fading

The blockchain represents:
- Incorruptible record-keeping
- Proof beyond manipulation
- A limit to absolute control

### The Double-Edged Sword

For The Foundation:
- Useful for tracking and analytics
- Dangerous for the permanence it provides

For Idols:
- Proof of fan investment
- Historical record of existence
- But also permanent tracking by Foundation

For Fans:
- True ownership of their connection
- Verifiable status and investment
- Participation that cannot be denied

## Canon Rules

### Blockchain Existence Inviolables

1. **SUI is the only native chain** — All core mechanics run on SUI
2. **Transactions are permanent** — Once on-chain, forever recorded
3. **The Foundation cannot alter blockchain** — A limit to their power
4. **Gems are real currency** — 1 SUI = 100 Gems, convertible
5. **NFTs represent true ownership** — Not database entries, real objects
6. **Multi-chain payments exist** — But convert to SUI/Gems on receipt

### Writing Guidelines

When writing about blockchain:

- Reference on-chain records as verifiable truth
- Contrast with Foundation-controlled systems
- Show the tension between control and permanence
- Gems are both game currency AND in-world economy
- Fans spending Gems should feel real, weighty

*"They thought they could erase me. Make it like I never existed. And they almost succeeded—I can see it in people's eyes, that vague confusion when they try to remember. But you know what they couldn't touch? The 47 wallets still holding their Battle Passes. Still showing their Gem purchases. Still proving they believed in me. The Foundation controls a lot. But they don't control the chain. Nobody does. That's the point."*
