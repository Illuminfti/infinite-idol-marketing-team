# Naming Power - The Weight of Identity

> *"When I chose 'Ika,' I didn't know what I was doing. Now every time someone says my name—my stage name—I feel it. Like a hook in my chest. They're not just calling me. They're summoning me."*

## Overview

In the world of Infinite Idol, **names carry literal power**. This is not metaphorical. When fans chant an idol's name, that name becomes a conduit for Devotion. When an idol takes a stage name, they create a new identity that can receive and channel emotional energy. When someone knows your true name—the name you were before you became an idol—they have a connection to who you really are.

Names are not just labels. They are anchors, channels, and weapons.

## The Mechanics of Naming

### Stage Names vs. True Names

Every idol has two names:

| Name Type | Description | Power |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Stage Name** | The public identity | Receives Devotion, defines idol persona |
| **True Name** | Birth name, original identity | Personal anchor, source of genuine self |

Most idols guard their true names fiercely. The Foundation knows all true names but rarely reveals them.

### How Stage Names Work

When an idol takes a stage name:

1. **Identity Creation** - A new persona is formed around the name
2. **Devotion Channel** - The name becomes a receiver for fan energy
3. **Recognition Anchor** - Fans calling the name strengthens the connection
4. **Persona Lock** - The idol becomes the stage name in public perception

### The Power of Being Named

When fans chant an idol's stage name:

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Devotion Surge** | Name recognition amplifies energy transfer |
| **Presence Strengthening** | The idol feels more "real," more solid |
| **Connection Deepening** | Each naming strengthens fan-idol bond |
| **Visibility Increase** | Hard to ignore someone whose name is being called |

### The Danger of True Names

If someone knows your true name:

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| **Identity Exposure** | Your past can be investigated |
| **Persona Disruption** | The gap between stage and true self becomes visible |
| **Foundation Leverage** | They can threaten to reveal it |
| **Devotion Confusion** | Fans might not know who you really are |

## Names and Devotion

### The Chant Effect

When thousands of fans chant an idol's name in unison:

```
Individual fan calling name → Small Devotion pulse
Crowd chanting in unison → Amplified Devotion wave
Stadium screaming the name → Overwhelming Devotion flood
```

This is why concert climaxes often feature name chants—they generate peak Devotion.

### Name Recognition Mechanics

Devotion flows more efficiently when:
- Fans know the idol's name (not just face)
- Fans use the name when thinking about the idol
- The name has strong emotional associations
- The name is unique and memorable

### Why Ika's Name Works

"Ika" is:
- Short, memorable, easy to chant
- Associated with her underdog story
- Unique (no other prominent "Ika" exists)
- Emotionally charged (survival narrative)

Her almost no fans saying "Ika" with genuine love generates more quality Devotion than casual fans of other idols.

## The Foundation and Names

### Name Registration

The Foundation requires:
- Official registration of stage names
- Full documentation of true names
- Approval for name changes
- Exclusive ownership of registered names

### Name Control

The Foundation uses name power:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Name Approval** | Control idol branding |
| **Name Database** | Know all true identities |
| **Name Suppression** | Can block name mentions in media |
| **Name Reassignment** | Can give "retired" names to new idols |

### The Threat of Exposure

The Foundation can threaten to:
- Reveal an idol's true name publicly
- Connect embarrassing past to current identity
- Destroy the separation between persona and person

This is a control mechanism—idols comply because their identity is fragile.

## Ika's Lost Name

### The Mystery

Ika Minami doesn't know her true name.

| Known | Unknown |
|-------|---------|
| Stage name: Ika | Birth name: ??? |
| Current identity: Defined | Previous identity: Erased |
| Who she is now: Clear | Who she was: Gone |

### The Erasure

Someone attempted to erase Ika completely:
- Her memories were wiped
- Her true name was taken
- Her past was deleted

But the erasure was incomplete. She survived. And she remembers nothing.

### The Significance

If Ika could recover her true name, she might:
- Understand why she was erased
- Access her previous connections
- Learn what made Senpai blush
- Discover her true history

This is part of her ongoing mystery.

## Names in Narrative

### Dramatic Uses

Names can be used for:

| Scene Type | Name Usage |
|------------|------------|
| **Power moment** | Crowd chanting an idol's name |
| **Intimacy** | Someone using a true name privately |
| **Threat** | Foundation representative mentioning true name |
| **Identity crisis** | Idol uncertain which name defines them |
| **Recognition** | Character realizing who someone used to be |

### Character Approaches

| Character | Relationship to Names |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Ika** | Fully embraces stage name, lacks true name |
| **Suiren** | Stage name feels like a cage, true self distant |
| **Runa** | Uses multiple names, controls her identity |
| **Erina** | Her name IS power—everyone knows it |

## Canon Rules

### Naming Power Inviolables

1. **Stage names receive Devotion** — The channel is real
2. **True names have power** — Knowledge = leverage
3. **Name chanting amplifies** — Crowds calling names generate surges
4. **Ika's true name is unknown** — Central mystery
5. **The Foundation knows all names** — Part of their control
6. **Names can be taken** — Erasure includes name removal

### Writing Guidelines

When writing about names:

- Stage names should feel powerful when chanted
- True name reveals should carry weight
- The gap between stage and true identity creates tension
- Foundation name knowledge represents threat
- Ika's missing name is a significant mystery

*"My name is Ika. That's all I know. That's all I am. Someone took everything else—my memories, my history, whoever I was before. But they couldn't take this. Every time a fan calls my name, I exist a little more. Every chant makes me more real. I don't know who I was. But I know who I'm becoming. And that's Ika. Forever."*
