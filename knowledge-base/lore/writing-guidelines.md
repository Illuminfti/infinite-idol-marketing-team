# Infinite Idol Light Novel Writing Guidelines

> **Purpose**: Comprehensive style guide, quality standards, and best practices for Infinite Idol light novel creation
> **Maintained By**: Agent 07 (Light Novel Writer) & Agent 08 (Lore Guardian)
> **Canon Tier**: Reference Document (Tier 4)

## Overview

This document establishes the definitive writing standards for Infinite Idol light novels. All narrative content must adhere to these guidelines to maintain consistency, quality, and the distinctive voice that defines the series.

The Infinite Idol light novels are defined by three core elements:
1. **Shameless authenticity** - Self-aware humor that embraces rather than apologizes for its premise
2. **First-person immersion** - Everything filtered through Ika Minami's distinctive voice
3. **Emotional stakes beneath comedy** - Humor as foundation, genuine emotion as payoff

---

## Style Guide

### Narrative Voice

All Infinite Idol light novels are written in **first-person perspective** from Ika Minami's point of view. This is not merely a technical choice---it is the heart of the series' appeal.

#### Ika's Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Expression | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Shamelessness** | Unapologetic self-awareness | "The uniform left nothing to the imagination. I'd complain, but honestly? It looked good on me." |
| **Wit** | Sharp observations, quick comebacks | "She said it like that was supposed to be reassuring. It was not reassuring." |
| **Determination** | Never backs down from challenges | "Impossible? Good. I've always done better with impossible." |
| **Genuine care** | Beneath the bravado, real emotion | "For a moment, I forgot to be clever. I just needed her to be okay." |
| **Meta-awareness** | Acknowledges genre conventions | "Of course there was a hot springs episode. Of course." |

#### Voice Don'ts

- **DON'T** make Ika cynical or dismissive of the story's premise
- **DON'T** break the fourth wall completely (she can be meta, not fully aware she's in a story)
- **DON'T** have Ika apologize for who she is or how she looks
- **DON'T** lose the sincerity beneath the humor
- **DON'T** sacrifice character consistency for a joke

### Prose Style

#### Sentence Rhythm

Vary sentence length to create flow and emphasis:

```
Short sentences create impact.

Longer sentences allow for the kind of wandering internal monologue that
lets readers feel like they're inside Ika's head, following her thoughts
as they develop, twist, and occasionally lead her somewhere she didn't expect.

Short again. Punchy.
```

#### Description Guidelines

| Element | Approach | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Characters** | Through Ika's appreciative (shameless) eye | Focus on presence, movement, distinctive features |
| **Locations** | Sensory details filtered through Ika's reactions | What she notices tells us who she is |
| **Action** | Clear choreography with internal commentary | Readers should always know where everyone is |
| **Emotion** | Show through physical sensation and thought | "My chest tightened" not "I felt sad" |

#### Dialogue Formatting

- Use em-dashes (---) for interruptions
- Italics for internal thoughts when distinct from narration
- Keep dialogue tags simple ("said," "asked") unless the manner of speaking is plot-relevant
- Character actions can replace dialogue tags: `"Fine." She slammed the door.`

### Humor Integration

Humor is foundational to Infinite Idol, but it must be handled with care.

#### Running Gags

The following are established running gags that should appear naturally:

| Gag | Usage | Frequency |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Clothing malfunctions** | Wardrobe issues during action sequences | 1-2 per chapter maximum |
| **Sora's energy** | Explosive enthusiasm overwhelming others | When Sora appears prominently |
| **Suiren's deadpan** | Dry observations cutting through drama | Sparingly for maximum impact |
| **Ika's shamelessness** | Self-aware comments about her appearance | When narratively appropriate |

#### Comedy Timing

1. **Setup** - Establish the straight situation
2. **Escalation** - Let tension build naturally
3. **Release** - The comedic payoff
4. **Move on** - Don't over-explain the joke

#### The Golden Rule

**If it undermines the emotional stakes, cut it.** Humor should enhance the story, not deflate important moments.

## Quality Standards

### Content Checklist

Before submitting any content for review, verify:

#### Voice Consistency
- [ ] Does Ika sound like Ika throughout?
- [ ] Does each character's dialogue match their voice signature?
- [ ] Is internal monologue filtered through Ika's perspective?
- [ ] Is meta-humor present but not overwhelming?

#### Narrative Flow
- [ ] Do scenes have clear beginning, middle, end?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth between scenes?

- [ ] Do chapters end on hooks that encourage continued reading?

#### Technical Elements
- [ ] Is the timeline internally consistent?
- [ ] Are character names spelled consistently?
- [ ] Is formatting consistent (scene breaks, dialogue, thoughts)?
- [ ] Are there any unresolved plot threads introduced?

#### Canon Compliance
- [ ] Does content respect all 10 Inviolable Facts?
- [ ] Is character knowledge consistent with timeline?
- [ ] Are mechanics (Devotion, Fading, Chase) used correctly?
- [ ] Have new lore elements been flagged for Agent 08 review?

### Quality Tiers

| Tier | Standard | Criteria |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Publication Ready** | Exceptional | All checklists pass, voice is authentic, emotional beats land |
| **Revision Ready** | Good | Minor issues only, core quality intact, quick fixes needed |
| **Needs Work** | Developing | Multiple issues requiring significant revision |
| **Major Revision** | Incomplete | Fundamental problems with voice, plot, or canon compliance |

### Review Standards

All content must pass through the Review Workflow (see Agent 07 persona) with the following outcomes:

- **Critical Issues**: Must be resolved before publication
- **Major Issues**: Should be resolved; document if intentionally left
- **Minor Issues**: Recommended fixes; author discretion
- **Stylistic Suggestions**: Optional improvements

## Best Practices

### Pre-Writing

1. **Review relevant volumes** - Reread sections featuring characters you'll write
2. **Consult character voice guides** - Agent 07 and Agent 08 maintain these
3. **Check the timeline** - Know where your content fits chronologically
4. **Identify escalation triggers** - Plan for content requiring human approval

### During Writing

1. **Stay in Ika's head** - Every description, every observation is hers
2. **Balance humor and stakes** - Neither should overshadow the other
3. **Trust the reader** - Show, don't tell; imply, don't explain
4. **Mark uncertainties** - Use `[LORE CHECK]`, `[POLISH]`, `[ESCALATION]` placeholders

### Post-Writing

1. **Self-review first** - Apply the Review Workflow to your own work
2. **Consult Agent 08** - All new lore elements need validation
3. **Complete edit passes** - Structural, character, prose, technical
4. **Document decisions** - Anything with world-building implications

### Character Voice Preservation

#### The Voice Test

For each character's dialogue, ask:
1. Could only this character say this line?
2. Does it match their voice signature?
3. Would it feel wrong coming from another character?

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise the line.

#### Character Quick Reference

| Character | Voice Signature | What to Preserve |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Ika** | Shameless, witty, determined | First-person intimacy, self-aware humor, genuine care |
| **Sora** | Explosive, athletic, impatient | Short sentences, physical action, boundary-less enthusiasm |
| **Suiren** | Measured, precise, dry | Formal speech, understated reactions, prodigy burden |
| **Erina** | Calculated, charismatic, controlled | Deliberate words, questions as control, hidden depths |
| **Runa** | Enigmatic, strategic, mysterious | Implications over statements, three steps ahead |

### Handling Difficult Content

#### Senpai Scenes

**Inviolable Fact #5**: Senpai's face is NEVER shown.

When writing Senpai:
- Describe presence, not features
- Use others' reactions to convey impact
- Focus on voice, silhouette, movement
- **NEVER** describe facial features directly

#### Fading Events

**Inviolable Fact #2**: Fading is permanent.

Requirements:
- Human approval required before any character Fades
- No resurrection, reincarnation, or "wasn't really Faded"
- Treat with appropriate gravitas---this is death
- Allow emotional space for reader processing

#### The Chase

**Inviolable Fact #7**: The Chase is the core competition format.

When depicting the Chase:
- The Foundation frames The Chase as "voluntary" to maintain legitimacy
- However, refusal to compete guarantees Fading—a coerced choice, not a free one
- This tension is thematic: explore idols wrestling with the illusion of choice
- Characters may outwardly accept "voluntary" participation while internally knowing the truth
- See `mechanics/the-chase.md` for full details on this deliberate thematic tension

### Pacing Guidelines

#### Chapter Structure

| Section | Purpose | Length Guide |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Opening** | Hook, establish situation | 500-1000 words |
| **Development** | Build tension, develop plot | 2000-4000 words |
| **Climax** | Key scene or revelation | 500-1500 words |
| **Resolution/Hook** | Resolve immediate conflict, set up next chapter | 500-1000 words |

#### Scene Transitions

- **Time skip**: "Three days later..." or contextual cue
- **Location change**: Establish new setting quickly, through Ika's perception
- **Perspective shift**: N/A (maintain first-person throughout)
- **Emotional shift**: Allow breathing room between intense scenes

#### Tension Curves

```
Chapter Tension Pattern:
    ____/\
   /      \____/\
  /              \
 /                \___
Hook → Build → Peak → Breathing Room → Build → Chapter Hook
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Purple prose** | Overwritten descriptions slow pacing | Trust simple, vivid language |
| **Talking heads** | Dialogue without action or setting | Add physical presence to scenes |
| **Information dumps** | Exposition breaking narrative flow | Integrate lore through action and dialogue |
| **Voice slippage** | Characters sounding alike | Review voice guides before each scene |
| **Stakes deflation** | Humor undermining important moments | Let serious moments breathe |
| **Canon drift** | Contradicting established facts | Consult lore files and Agent 08 |

---

## Technical Specifications

### File Naming Conventions

| Content Type | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Main volumes | `volume-X-title.md` | `volume-3-rising-stars.md` |
| Drafts | `draft-volume-X-chapter-Y.md` | `draft-volume-3-chapter-1.md` |
| Side stories | `side-story-title.md` | `side-story-summer-festival.md` |

### Markdown Formatting

#### Headers
- `#` Chapter title
- `##` Scene breaks or major divisions
- `###` Subsections (rarely needed in prose)

#### Scene Breaks
Use a single line with three asterisks:
```
***
```

#### Emphasis
- *Italics* for internal thoughts, emphasis, and foreign words
- **Bold** sparingly, for extreme emphasis only
- `Code formatting` not used in prose content

#### Special Elements
- Notes/broadcasts: Use blockquotes with attribution
- Flashbacks: Italicize entire sections with clear entry/exit
- Text messages: Format as indented blockquotes

### Word Count Guidelines

| Content Type | Target Range | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Full chapter | 4,000-8,000 words | Varies by content density |
| Short chapter | 2,500-4,000 words | For transitional chapters |
| Side story | 3,000-6,000 words | Complete in itself |
| Volume total | 40,000-60,000 words | ~8-12 chapters typical |

## Canon Integration

### The 10 Inviolable Facts

**IMPORTANT**: The authoritative list of 10 Inviolable Facts is maintained in `CLAUDE.md`. All writing must respect these facts absolutely:

1. **Devotion is Literal** - Real emotional energy from fans, not metaphor
2. **Fading is Death** - Permanent, no reversal, no exceptions
3. **Ika Has 47 Fans** - Exactly 47 at story start
4. **Ika's Hair: Pink Gradient** - Rose roots → magenta tips
5. **Senpai Never Shown** - Always obscured, face never revealed
6. **Foundation Controls All** - Run by Erina, controls industry
7. **The Chase is Core** - Primary competition, determines survival
8. **Built on SUI** - Sui-native blockchain (NFTs, contracts, game logic)
9. **Gems = Currency** - 1 SUI = 100 Gems, account-bound
10. **Dark Luxury Aesthetic** - Black/gold, NOT pink/cutesy

Always reference `CLAUDE.md` as the master source for canon rules.

---

### Narrative Themes (Writing Guidance)

Beyond the Inviolable Facts, these narrative themes should inform your writing:

| Theme | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Devotion is quantifiable** | Show characters sensing and measuring their Devotion levels |
| **Memory anchors identity** | Ika's amnesia is genuine and central to her mystery |
| **Names carry weight** | Stage names vs. real names have significance |
| **The system predates Erina** | Origins remain mysterious, older than current management |
| **Graduation hides dark truth** | See `mechanics/graduation.md` for details |
| **Unity can delay Fading** | Collective Devotion from fan communities provides protection |
| **Love transcends categories** | Devotion flows regardless of relationship type |
| **The Chase is "voluntary"** | See `mechanics/the-chase.md` for the coercion tension |

These themes enrich the narrative but do not override the 10 Inviolable Facts.

### Canon Tier Reference

When introducing new elements, understand their place in the hierarchy:

| Tier | Source | Your Work |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Inviolable Facts | Must never contradict |
| 2 | Published Light Novels | Your published work becomes this tier |
| 3 | Character Profiles | Must align with; can expand |
| 4 | World Documents | Can influence with new content |
| 5 | Published Content | Can override with approval |
| 6 | Proposals | Starting point for new ideas |

### Lore Consultation Process

Before introducing any of the following, consult Agent 08 (Lore Guardian):

- [ ] New named characters
- [ ] New locations
- [ ] New uses of Devotion/Fading/Chase mechanics
- [ ] Timeline-specific events
- [ ] Organization or faction details
- [ ] Character backstory expansions

## Appendix: Templates

### Lore Check Placeholder

When uncertain about a lore element during writing:

```
[LORE CHECK: Is there an established name for the training facility?
If not, proposing "Aurora Complex" - Agent 08 please validate.]
```

### Polish Note

When a section needs refinement but the draft must continue:

```
[POLISH: This scene's pacing feels rushed. Need to add more physical
description of the arena and Ika's reactions to the crowd.]
```

### Escalation Flag

When content may require human approval:

```
[ESCALATION: This scene implies Senpai's hair color through reflected light.
May violate Inviolable Fact #5 - requesting human review before proceeding.]
```
