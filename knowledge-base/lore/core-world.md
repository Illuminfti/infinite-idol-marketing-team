# Core World - The Infinite Idol Universe

> *"Every idol runs. Every fan watches. Every Devotion matters. Welcome to the Eternal Stage."*

---

## Overview

The world of **Infinite Idol** exists on the precipice between existence and oblivion. Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.

The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.

## The Eternal Stage

### What It Is

The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.

### Characteristics

- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.
- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.
- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.
- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.

### The Significance

To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.

## Devotion

### Definition

**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols. It is not a metaphor or a currency symbol—it is a tangible force that idols can feel, draw upon, and are sustained by.

### How It Works

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Generated by fans through attention, care, and emotional investment |
| **Flow** | Transfers to idols through viewership, merchandise purchase, fan engagement |
| **Manifestation** | Idols can sense their Devotion levels; higher Devotion grants strength, visibility, opportunity |
| **Consumption** | Performing, competing, and simply existing consumes Devotion |
| **Accumulation** | Success breeds success—popular idols attract more fans, generating more Devotion |

### The Economics of Devotion

Devotion is not distributed equally. The system favors those already at the top:

- **Top-tier idols**: Thousands to millions of fans, overflowing Devotion, safety from Fading
- **Mid-tier idols**: Hundreds to thousands of fans, sustainable but precarious
- **Low-tier idols**: Dozens to hundreds of fans, constant existential threat
- **Endangered idols**: Single-digit fans, active Fading in progress

### Canon Rule

> *"Devotion is the literal emotional energy fans invest in idols. It is not metaphorical. Idols can feel it, use it, and are sustained by it. Without Devotion, idols Fade."*

## The Chase

### Overview

**The Chase** is the core competition format of the Infinite Idol universe. It is not merely a race—it is a pursuit of the ultimate prize: **Senpai**.

### Format

1. **Start**: All competing idols begin at designated positions on the Eternal Stage
2. **Pursuit**: Idols race through a dynamic obstacle course, each trying to reach Senpai first
3. **Senpai's Presence**: Senpai appears ahead, always just out of reach, always obscured
4. **Competition**: Idols compete against each other AND the course itself
5. **Conclusion**: The Chase ends when time expires or conditions are met—but Senpai is never caught

### The Obstacles

Each Chase presents unique challenges:

- **Physical**: Walls, gaps, moving platforms, environmental hazards
- **Mental**: Puzzles, decision points, strategic trade-offs
- **Social**: Opportunities to collaborate or betray other idols
- **Devotion-based**: Challenges that consume or test an idol's Devotion reserves

### Rankings

Performance in The Chase directly determines rankings:

| Rank Tier | Status | Devotion Access | Risk Level |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **S-Rank** | Elite | Priority access to fan pools | Minimal |
| **A-Rank** | Established | Strong Devotion flow | Low |
| **B-Rank** | Competitive | Moderate Devotion | Medium |
| **C-Rank** | Struggling | Limited Devotion | High |
| **Unranked** | Desperate | Scraps only | Critical |

### Canon Rule

> *"The Chase is the primary competition format. Idols race through obstacle courses pursuing Senpai. Rankings in The Chase determine status, Devotion flow, and survival. The Chase occurs on the Eternal Stage."*

## Fading

### What It Is

**Fading** is what happens when an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero. It is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist.

### The Process

Fading is not instantaneous. It occurs in stages:

1. **Dimming**: The idol becomes less visible, less present. Others start to forget them.
2. **Flickering**: Physical form becomes unstable. Moments of clarity interspersed with absence.
3. **Silence**: The idol can no longer be heard. Their voice carries no weight.
4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.
5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.

### Reversibility

There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:

- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero
- Spectacular performances that recapture attention
- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)

### The Terror

Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol. It is why:

- Competition is so fierce
- Betrayals occur
- Some idols will do anything to stay visible
- Every Chase matters

### Canon Rule

> *"When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they Fade. Fading is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist. There is no known way to reverse Fading."*

## Tournament Structure

### Seasonal Format

The competitive calendar is organized into **Seasons**, each culminating in major Chase events:

| Event Type | Frequency | Stakes | Participants |
|------------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Daily Chases** | Every day | Minor ranking adjustments | Open to all |
| **Weekly Showdowns** | Weekly | Moderate ranking impact | Ranked idols |
| **Monthly Galas** | Monthly | Major ranking shifts | Top performers |
| **Seasonal Finals** | End of season | Rankings reset, prizes distributed | Elite qualifiers |
| **The Grand Chase** | Annual | Legendary status, massive rewards | Champions only |

### Qualification

- **Daily Chases**: No qualification needed—survival is qualification enough
- **Weekly Showdowns**: Must maintain minimum ranking
- **Monthly Galas**: Top performers from weekly events
- **Seasonal Finals**: Season's accumulated performance
- **The Grand Chase**: Champions from each seasonal final

### Rewards

Success in The Chase yields:

- **Ranking Improvements**: Better position = better Devotion access
- **Fan Exposure**: Winners are featured, gaining new followers
- **Resources**: Gems, cosmetics, exclusive access
- **Safety**: Higher ranks provide buffer against Fading

### The Brutal Truth

The tournament structure is designed to concentrate success. The rich get richer. The popular become more popular. Those at the bottom must claw their way up or face oblivion.

This is by design. **The Foundation** maintains this system.

## The Senpai Mystery

### Who Is Senpai?

**Senpai** (also called **Onii-chan**) is the figure at the heart of The Chase. Every idol pursues Senpai. No idol has ever caught them.

### What We Know

- Senpai's face is **never shown**—always obscured by shadow, lens flare, or turned away
- Senpai appears at every Chase, always ahead, always just out of reach
- The desire to catch Senpai seems intrinsic to every idol's nature
- Catching Senpai is believed to grant... something. No one knows what.

### What We Don't Know

- Why do idols want to catch Senpai?
- Is Senpai a person, a concept, or something else?
- Can Senpai be caught at all?
- What happens if someone does?

### Canon Rule

> *"Senpai is the figure all idols chase in The Chase. Senpai's face is NEVER shown. They are always obscured by shadow, lens flare, or turned away. No one has ever caught Senpai."*

- The Chase is the central competitive framework
- Tournament structures drive seasonal content

### For Narrative

- Stakes are always existentially high
- The system is oppressive by design
- Hope exists, but it is hard-won
