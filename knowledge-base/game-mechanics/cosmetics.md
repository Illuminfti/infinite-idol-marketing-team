# COSMETICS SYSTEM - Complete Item Specification

> *"Every piece you wear tells a story. That headpiece? From my 500th fan. These gloves? My first Legendary pull. When you see an idol dripping in black and gold, you're seeing Devotion made visible."*
> — Ika Minami, Cosmetics Tutorial

## Overview

The **Cosmetics System** is the visual expression of player investment in Infinite Idol. With 30 complete outfit sets distributed across 5 families, 9 equippable item slots, and a robust rarity system, cosmetics provide both aesthetic customization and visible status signaling.

All cosmetic items are NFTs on the SUI blockchain—tradable, collectible, and permanent. Players obtain cosmetics through the lootbox system and can recycle duplicates via the burn system. Nothing is purely "lost"—every pull contributes to the collection or becomes fuel for new chances.

## Burn System

### Standard Burn

Duplicate items can be recycled into new chances:

| Input | Output | Requirements |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| 4 duplicate items (same family) | 1 Lootbox (same family) | Items must be unequipped |
| Any 4 duplicate items (mixed family) | 1 Random Family Lootbox | Items must be unequipped |

### Burn Process

```
Item Burn Flow:
1. Player selects 4+ duplicate items from inventory
2. System verifies: same item? Unequipped? Same family?
3. Confirmation prompt shows input and output
4. Player confirms burn transaction
5. Item NFTs permanently destroyed (burned)
6. New lootbox NFT minted to wallet
7. Animation plays (burning into new box)
```

### Burn Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Minimum Count** | Must burn exactly 4 items |
| **Same Item Required** | All 4 must be identical (same item ID) |
| **Unequipped Only** | Cannot burn equipped items |
| **Irreversible** | Burned items cannot be recovered |
| **Instant Output** | New lootbox minted immediately |
| **Same Family Output** | Burn A-family items → A Box |

| 40,000 items burned | 1 Diamond Lootbox | Yes |

### Burn Philosophy

The burn system serves multiple purposes:

| Purpose | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Duplicate Value** | No pull is truly wasted |
| **Collection Recycling** | Excess items become new chances |
| **Secondary Pursuit** | Prestige milestones add goals |
| **Economy Circulation** | Items leave supply through burning |
| **Deflationary Pressure** | Reduces total NFT supply over time |

| Bonus Type | Requirement | Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Half Set** | 3 pieces from same set | Minor visual enhancement |
| **Full Set** | 6 pieces from same set | Full set glow + bonus animation |
| **Legendary Set** | 6 Legendary pieces from same set | Ultimate visual effect |
| **Cross-Family** | 1 Legendary from each family | Special aura |

### Set Completion Tracking

> Cosmetics on the Eternal Stage aren't mere clothes—they're crystallized Devotion. When fans pour their love into an idol, that energy manifests as wearable art. The rarer the devotion's intensity, the more spectacular the manifestation. A Legendary item isn't just rare—it's proof of the purest devotion.
