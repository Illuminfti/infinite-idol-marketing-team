# Voice and Tone - Infinite Idol Brand Guidelines

> *"We know exactly what we are. We're shameless about it. And we're damn good at it."*

---

## Overview

The Infinite Idol voice is **shameless but genuine, self-aware, dark luxury, existentially dramatic**. We are not another cutesy idol game hiding behind innocence. We acknowledge what we're making—a gacha game designed to captivate, monetize, and entertain. But we do it with craft, with care, and with genuine love for the world we've built.

This document defines how Infinite Idol speaks across all channels, from Twitter threads to Discord announcements, from Ika's in-character posts to behind-the-scenes founder updates.

## Core Voice Pillars

### 1. Shameless But Genuine

**What It Means**

We don't hide from what we are. We're making a gacha game. We want players to spend money. We design systems that encourage engagement and spending. This is not something to apologize for—it's something to own with confidence.

But here's the twist: we're also genuine. We actually care about the world, the characters, the story. This isn't cynical IP extraction. We love Ika. We believe in the Eternal Stage. We want players to feel something real.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Yes, it's a gacha game. A really good one." | "It's not *really* about the gacha..." |
| "We designed this banner to be irresistible." | "We hope you'll consider supporting us." |
| "Ika wants your Devotion. So do we." | "Please become a fan if you can!" |
| "We built this world because we love it." | "This is just a business venture." |

**Examples**

> "New banner dropping tomorrow. We put our heart into designing these cosmetics to separate you from your SUI. And honestly? They're gorgeous. You're going to want them."

> "We're a gacha game. We're Web3. We're anime idols. Everything you've been warned about. But we're also genuinely good. Stick around and we'll prove it."

---

### 2. Self-Aware

**What It Means**

We know the tropes. We know the criticisms. We know what people say about gacha games, about Web3 games, about idol games. Instead of pretending we're different, we acknowledge the landscape and then transcend it.

Self-awareness isn't self-deprecation. We're not mocking ourselves—we're demonstrating intelligence. We see the meta-game and we play it knowingly.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Another gacha game? Yes. But hear us out." | "We're totally unique and different!" |
| "You've seen this mechanic before. We do it better." | "We invented revolutionary gameplay." |
| "Web3 gaming has a reputation. We're here to change it." | "Web3 gaming is perfect and misunderstood!" |
| "Idols chasing Senpai. It's exactly what you think. And more." | "Our narrative is incomparably original." |

**Examples**

> "Yes, the odds are 3% for Legendary. Yes, you're going to pull anyway. Yes, we know. That's why we made the Legendary items this good."

> "Infinite Idol is built on SUI. Before you roll your eyes—we're gameplay-first, blockchain-second. The crypto part exists to make ownership real, not to make us look innovative."

### 3. Dark Luxury

**What It Means**

We are premium. We are sleek. We are black and gold, not pink and sparkles. This is not Love Live. This is not Hololive. We're closer to NIKKE—confident, adult, sophisticated.

Our aesthetic is:
- **Black**: Deep, rich, absorbing—the void that idols fear
- **Gold**: Premium, aspirational, the gleam of success
- **Rose/Magenta accents**: Ika's signature colors, warmth within darkness
- **Minimalist elegance**: Clean lines, intentional space, no clutter

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Dripping in elegance." | "Super cute and kawaii!" |
| "The Eternal Stage demands excellence." | "Have fun on the stage, everyone!" |
| "Premium cosmetics for premium idols." | "Adorable outfits for your favorites!" |
| "Darkness awaits those who Fade." | "Oh no, they might disappear!" |

**Language Guidelines**

- Use **elevated vocabulary**: "elegance" not "prettiness", "devastating" not "sad"
- Avoid diminutives: no "little", "tiny", "cute", "adorable" unless specifically ironic
- Embrace dramatic phrasing: "The Eternal Stage demands" > "The Stage wants"
- Keep sentences confident: declarative statements, not questions seeking validation

**Examples**

> "The new Midnight Empress collection. Five pieces. Obsidian and gold. For idols who don't just want to be seen—they want to be remembered."

> "Ika's latest outfit wasn't designed. It was forged. In the fires of competition. From the tears of her rivals."

### 4. Existentially Dramatic

**What It Means**

In Infinite Idol, the stakes are real. Idols don't just lose—they Fade from existence. Fans don't just watch—they literally keep their idols alive. This existential weight informs everything.

We lean into the drama. Every Chase matters. Every ranking shift is life or death. Every fan gained is survival. This isn't overdramatic—within our world, it's simply accurate.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Your Devotion keeps her existing." | "Support your favorite idol!" |
| "Fight for your place on the Eternal Stage." | "Compete in fun events!" |
| "47 fans. It's not enough. It's barely existing." | "She needs more fans to be popular!" |
| "The Foundation controls who lives and who Fades." | "The Foundation manages the rankings." |

**Tone Calibration**

- **Heavy moments**: Full existential weight, no humor
- **Lighter moments**: Dramatic undercurrent, but room for wit
- **Hype moments**: Channel existential stakes into excitement
- **Community moments**: Warmth exists within the darkness

**Examples**

> "Tomorrow's Chase determines who rises and who fades. There is no participation trophy. Only survival."

> "Ika woke up with 47 fans. Most idols have thousands. She exists on borrowed time and borrowed devotion. And she wouldn't have it any other way."

> "Every gem you spend fuels the Eternal Stage. Every idol you support delays their Fading. This isn't a game. It's a lifeline."

|---------|---------|
| Direct address to fans | "You. Yes, you reading this." |

| Senpai obsession | "I will catch Senpai. Watch me." |

**Sample Ika Tweets**

> "Another day of being the idol with 47 fans in a world of millions. Some call it hopeless. I call it intimate~"

> "They laughed when I entered The Chase. They're not laughing anymore. Well, some still are. But they won't be for long."

> "To my 47: You are the reason I exist. Literally. Without your Devotion, I would Fade. So... don't stop watching, okay? Please?"

> "Senpai appeared again today. As always, I couldn't catch them. As always, I got closer than anyone else. As always, I will try again."
