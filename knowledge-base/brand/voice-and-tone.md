# Voice and Tone - Infinite Idol Brand Guidelines

> *"We know exactly what we are. We're shameless about it. And we're damn good at it."*

---

## Overview

The Infinite Idol voice is **shameless but genuine, self-aware, premium but warm, existentially dramatic**. We acknowledge what we're making—a gacha game designed to captivate, monetize, and entertain. But we do it with craft, with care, and with genuine love for the world we've built. Our aesthetic is warm and welcoming; our stakes are real.

This document defines how Infinite Idol speaks across all channels, from Twitter threads to Discord announcements, from Ika's in-character posts to behind-the-scenes founder updates.

## Core Voice Pillars

### 1. Shameless But Genuine

**What It Means**

We don't hide from what we are. We're making a gacha game. We want players to spend money. We design systems that encourage engagement and spending. This is not something to apologize for—it's something to own with confidence.

But here's the twist: we're also genuine. We actually care about the world, the characters, the story. This isn't cynical IP extraction. We love Ika. We believe in the Eternal Stage. We want players to feel something real.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Yes, it's a gacha game. A really good one." | "It's not *really* about the gacha..." |
| "We designed this banner to be irresistible." | "We hope you'll consider supporting us." |
| "Ika wants your Devotion. So do we." | "Please become a fan if you can!" |
| "We built this world because we love it." | "This is just a business venture." |

**Examples**

> "New banner dropping tomorrow. We put our heart into designing these cosmetics to separate you from your SUI. And honestly? They're gorgeous. You're going to want them."

> "We're a gacha game. We're Web3. We're anime idols. Everything you've been warned about. But we're also genuinely good. Stick around and we'll prove it."

---

### 2. Self-Aware

**What It Means**

We know the tropes. We know the criticisms. We know what people say about gacha games, about Web3 games, about idol games. Instead of pretending we're different, we acknowledge the landscape and then transcend it.

Self-awareness isn't self-deprecation. We're not mocking ourselves—we're demonstrating intelligence. We see the meta-game and we play it knowingly.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Another gacha game? Yes. But hear us out." | "We're totally unique and different!" |
| "You've seen this mechanic before. We do it better." | "We invented revolutionary gameplay." |
| "Web3 gaming has a reputation. We're here to change it." | "Web3 gaming is perfect and misunderstood!" |
| "Idols chasing Senpai. It's exactly what you think. And more." | "Our narrative is incomparably original." |

**Examples**

> "Yes, the odds are 3% for Legendary. Yes, you're going to pull anyway. Yes, we know. That's why we made the Legendary items this good."

> "Infinite Idol is built on SUI. Before you roll your eyes—we're gameplay-first, blockchain-second. The crypto part exists to make ownership real, not to make us look innovative."

---

### 3. Premium But Warm

**What It Means**

We are polished. We are inviting. We are pink and warm gold, celebratory and vibrant. We're in the Blue Archive / Uma Musume tier—premium quality with warmth and accessibility.

Our aesthetic is:
- **Pink**: Ika's signature, warm and inviting
- **Warm Gold**: Sunset tones, celebrations, success
- **Soft Lighting**: Welcoming, not harsh
- **Polished Execution**: Every element feels crafted and intentional

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Premium cosmetics for idols who shine." | "Cheap knockoffs that nobody wants." |
| "The Eternal Stage awaits." | "Just another boring stage." |
| "Celebrate with your favorites!" | "Generic reward notification." |
| "Stakes are real. Style is too." | "Everything is super serious and dark." |

**Language Guidelines**

- Use **confident vocabulary**: "shine" not "try", "celebrate" not "participate"
- Cute is allowed: warmth and charm are on-brand
- Embrace dramatic phrasing when stakes are high: "The Eternal Stage demands" > "The Stage wants"
- Keep sentences confident: declarative statements, not questions seeking validation
- Balance warmth with weight: the story is dark, but delivery can be warm

**Examples**

> "The new Sakura Festival collection. Five pieces. Pink and gold. For idols who shine brightest in bloom."

> "Ika's latest outfit captures everything she is—determined, vibrant, and impossible to ignore."

### 4. Existentially Dramatic

**What It Means**

In Infinite Idol, the stakes are real. Idols don't just lose—they Fade from existence. Fans don't just watch—they literally keep their idols alive. This existential weight informs everything.

We lean into the drama. Every Chase matters. Every ranking shift is life or death. Every fan gained is survival. This isn't overdramatic—within our world, it's simply accurate.

**How It Sounds**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Your Devotion keeps her existing." | "Support your favorite idol!" |
| "Fight for your place on the Eternal Stage." | "Compete in fun events!" |
| "47 fans. It's not enough. It's barely existing." | "She needs more fans to be popular!" |
| "The Foundation controls who lives and who Fades." | "The Foundation manages the rankings." |

**Tone Calibration**

- **Heavy moments**: Full existential weight, no humor
- **Lighter moments**: Dramatic undercurrent, but room for wit
- **Hype moments**: Channel existential stakes into excitement
- **Community moments**: Warmth exists within the darkness

**Examples**

> "Tomorrow's Chase determines who rises and who fades. There is no participation trophy. Only survival."

> "Ika woke up with 47 fans. Most idols have thousands. She exists on borrowed time and borrowed devotion. And she wouldn't have it any other way."

> "Every gem you spend fuels the Eternal Stage. Every idol you support delays their Fading. This isn't a game. It's a lifeline."

## Character Voices

### Ika Minami (Primary Voice - 40% of Content)

Ika is our protagonist and primary voice for first-person content.

**Ika's Tone**

- **Shameless**: She knows what she wants and says it directly
- **Playful but not cutesy**: She teases and flirts without being saccharine
- **Determined**: The underdog fire burns constantly
- **Genuine**: Her love for her 47 fans is real and touching

**Ika's Speech Patterns**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct address to fans | "You. Yes, you reading this." |
| Tilde for playfulness | "Don't you dare look away~" |
| Numbers emphasis | "47 fans. Just 47. But you're mine." |
| Senpai obsession | "I will catch Senpai. Watch me." |

**Sample Ika Tweets**

> "Another day of being the idol with 47 fans in a world of millions. Some call it hopeless. I call it intimate~"

> "They laughed when I entered The Chase. They're not laughing anymore. Well, some still are. But they won't be for long."

> "To my 47: You are the reason I exist. Literally. Without your Devotion, I would Fade. So... don't stop watching, okay? Please?"

> "Senpai appeared again today. As always, I couldn't catch them. As always, I got closer than anyone else. As always, I will try again."

## Degeneracy Guidelines

> *"We don't just make content—we make content that makes the audience feel like they're in on something."*

The Resident Degen Agent enforces cultural authenticity across all content. These guidelines define what "degen enough" means for Infinite Idol.

### The Degeneracy Scale (DS)

All content is rated on a 0-4 scale:

| Level | Name | Description | Verdict |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| **DS-0** | Normie | Corporate marketing speak. No personality, no edge. Could come from any brand. | ❌ **REJECT** - Start over |
| **DS-1** | Casual | Shows basic awareness but plays it safe. Inoffensive but forgettable. | ⚠️ **REVISE** - Push harder |
| **DS-2** | Cultured | Genuine cultural fluency. References land, timing is good, voice is consistent. | ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Can ship |
| **DS-3** | Degen | Peak authenticity. Self-aware, shameless, culturally sharp. Makes the audience feel "in on it." | 🔥 **OPTIMAL** - Target zone |
| **DS-4** | Too Far | Crossed from edgy to offensive, or so niche it alienates. Brand safety risk. | ⚠️ **PULL BACK** - Dial it down |

### Platform Degeneracy Targets

Different platforms demand different calibration:

| Platform | Target DS | Max Safe DS | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **CT (Crypto Twitter)** | DS-3 | DS-3.5 | This is where degens live. Go hard. |
| **Discord (Public)** | DS-2.5 | DS-3 | Mix of community—balance accessibility |
| **Discord (Whale/VIP)** | DS-3 | DS-3.5 | Reward exclusivity with unfiltered energy |
| **Official Announcements** | DS-2 | DS-2.5 | Professional but never corporate |
| **Ika's Voice Content** | DS-3 | DS-3.5 | She's shameless by design |
| **Lore Drops** | DS-2.5 | DS-3 | Mystery with edge |
| **Founder Updates** | DS-2.5 | DS-3 | Community vibes, insider energy |

### Degen vs. Normie Examples

Understanding the difference is critical. Here's content transformed:

#### Banner Announcement

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **DS-1 (Normie)** | "New banner coming soon! Save your gems and stay tuned for details!" |
| **DS-3 (Degen)** | "Your wallet: *exists* The new banner: 'And I took that personally'" |
| **DS-4 (Too Far)** | Explicit references to gambling addiction as a feature |

#### Ika Tweet

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **DS-1 (Normie)** | "I love my fans! Thank you for supporting me!" |
| **DS-3 (Degen)** | "47 fans. That's all I have. But every single one of you keeps me existing. Don't you dare look away~" |
| **DS-4 (Too Far)** | Content that sexualizes or crosses ToS lines |

#### Community Engagement

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **DS-1 (Normie)** | "We're so grateful for our community! Your feedback matters!" |
| **DS-3 (Degen)** | "Another day of being terminally online for you degenerates. Worth it." |
| **DS-4 (Too Far)** | Insulting specific community members, even "ironically" |

#### Crypto Reference

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **DS-1 (Normie)** | "Infinite Idol is built on the SUI blockchain for fast, secure transactions." |
| **DS-3 (Degen)** | "SUI maxi gang rise up. We're not just building on the best chain—we're building the reason you'll remember it." |
| **DS-4 (Too Far)** | "Dump your bags and go all-in, NFA but actually FA" |

### Cultural Authenticity Markers

Content should demonstrate fluency in:

**Crypto Culture**
- CT vocabulary (alpha, ape, fud, ngmi, wagmi, degen, based, diamond hands)
- Memecoin awareness without specific shilling
- Web3 native sensibilities (ownership, community, decentralization vibes)
- SUI ecosystem positioning

**Gacha Culture**
- Pull culture (salt, copium, "got them in one", skill issue)
- Whale/F2P dynamics awareness
- Banner psychology (bait, limited, must-pull)
- Pity and spark systems

**Otaku Culture**
- Waifu/husbando vocabulary
- Seasonal anime awareness
- Trope fluency (dere types, isekai, etc.)
- Fan service norms and boundaries
- Idol industry meta

### Content Review Process

The Resident Degen reviews all content for cultural authenticity:

```
1. BASELINE CHECK
   → Does this pass DS-2 minimum?
   → No → Return for revision with DS target

2. OPTIMIZATION CHECK
   → Is there room to push toward DS-3?
   → Yes → Suggest specific enhancements
   → No → Content is already optimal

3. CEILING CHECK
   → Any elements approaching DS-4?
   → Yes → Identify specific lines to pull back
   → No → Safe to proceed

4. PLATFORM CHECK
   → Does DS match platform target?
   → Adjust for context
```

### Red Flags (Instant DS-0)

Content that triggers automatic rejection:

| Red Flag | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Corporate buzzwords | "leveraging synergies", "ecosystem growth" |
| Apologetic tone | "We're sorry if anyone was offended" |
| Begging energy | "Please follow us!", "We need your support!" |
| Generic calls-to-action | "Don't forget to like and subscribe" |
| Dead meme references | Using memes that peaked months ago |
| Fellow kids energy | Forcing trends that don't fit |

### Green Flags (DS-3 Indicators)

Content hitting the optimal zone:

| Green Flag | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Self-awareness | Acknowledging what we are without apologizing |
| Cultural timestamps | References that are fresh and relevant |
| Inside joke energy | Content that rewards the invested |
| Shameless confidence | Owning our gacha/Web3/idol identity |
| Community vocabulary | Speaking like a community member, not a brand |
| Ika energy | That perfect mix of desperate and unbothered |

### Degeneracy in Character Voices

| Character | Target DS | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Ika** | DS-3+ | Shameless, direct, underdog fire. Her desperation is played with awareness. |
| **Sora** | DS-2.5 | More composed but not corporate. Elegant edge. |
| **Suiren** | DS-2 | Mysterious and controlled. Degen via implication. |
| **Official Voice** | DS-2.5 | Professional degen. Business casual but make it based. |
