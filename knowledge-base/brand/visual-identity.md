# Visual Identity - Infinite Idol Brand Guidelines

> *"Black absorbs. Gold elevates. Together, they create something unforgettable."*

---

## Overview

Infinite Idol's visual identity embodies **dark luxury**—a premium, sophisticated aesthetic that sets us apart from the saccharine idol game market. We are not pink and sparkles. We are obsidian and gold, shadow and gleam, elegance forged in darkness.

This document defines the visual language of Infinite Idol across all touchpoints: game UI, marketing materials, social media assets, merchandise, and promotional content.

## Core Aesthetic Philosophy

### Dark Luxury, Not Pink Cutesy

This is our north star. Every visual decision flows from this principle.

| WE ARE | WE ARE NOT |
|--------|------------|
| Premium | Cheap |
| Sophisticated | Cutesy |
| Confident | Apologetic |
| Adult | Childish |
| NIKKE | Love Live |
| Obsidian and gold | Pink and sparkles |
| Intentional | Cluttered |
| Timeless elegance | Trendy kawaii |

### The Emotional Core

Our visuals should evoke:

- **Power**: The weight of existence, the stakes of survival
- **Aspiration**: Something worth striving for, worth spending for
- **Mystery**: Shadows that hide secrets, darkness that draws you in
- **Intimacy**: Personal connection despite grand scale
- **Danger**: Beautiful things that could destroy you

## Color System

### Primary Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage | Meaning |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Void Black** | `#0A0A0A` | Primary background | The darkness of Fading, the void idols fear |
| **Obsidian** | `#1A1A1A` | Secondary background, cards | Depth, premium surfaces |
| **Eternal Gold** | `#D4AF37` | Accents, highlights, premium elements | Success, aspiration, survival |
| **Pale Gold** | `#E8D5A3` | Text on dark, subtle accents | Elegance, readability |

### Secondary Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage | Meaning |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Rose Pink** | `#FF6B9D` | Ika's signature, warmth accents | Hope within darkness, Ika's spirit |
| **Magenta** | `#FF2D7B` | Ika's signature gradient tip | Passion, determination |
| **Crimson** | `#8B0000` | Danger, warnings, Fading alerts | Threat, urgency, mortality |
| **Silver** | `#C0C0C0` | Foundation elements, neutral UI | Authority, control, cold precision |

### Ika's Signature Gradient

Ika's hair gradient is sacred and must be consistent:

```
Rose Pink (#FF6B9D) → Magenta (#FF2D7B)
```

This gradient appears:
- In all Ika character art
- As accent gradients in Ika-focused content
- In the game UI when Ika is prominent
- NEVER as the dominant brand color (accent only)

### Color Hierarchy

```
Background: 60% - Void Black / Obsidian
Primary:    30% - Eternal Gold / Pale Gold
Accent:     10% - Rose/Magenta (Ika content) OR Crimson (danger/hype)
```

## Typography

### Primary Typefaces

| Usage | Typeface | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Headlines** | Cinzel Decorative | Elegant, premium, authority |
| **Subheadlines** | Montserrat Bold | Modern, confident, clean |
| **Body Text** | Source Sans Pro | Readable, professional, warm |
| **Accent/UI** | Rajdhani | Tech-forward, sharp, game-ready |

### Typography Rules

1. **Headlines**: Always uppercase for major announcements
2. **Body Text**: Sentence case, never all caps for extended reading
3. **Numbers**: Use tabular figures for rankings, statistics
4. **Spacing**: Generous letter-spacing for headlines (0.05em minimum)
5. **Weight**: Prefer bold weights; avoid light weights on dark backgrounds

### Sample Typography Treatments

**Major Announcement**
```
THE CHASE BEGINS
Premium limited banner • 24 hours only
```

**Character Introduction**
```
IKA MINAMI
"almost no fans. Every single one of them matters."
```

## What To Avoid

### Visual Don'ts

| NEVER DO | WHY |
|----------|-----|
| Pink as primary color | Contradicts dark luxury |
| Pastel palettes | Too soft, not premium |
| Busy, cluttered layouts | Cheap, amateur feeling |
| Generic anime sparkles | Overdone, expected |
| White backgrounds | Breaks the darkness |
| Rainbow gradients | Too playful, not serious |
| Comic Sans or rounded fonts | Destroys sophistication |
| Stock photo aesthetic | We are crafted, not templated |
| Bright, happy imagery | We embrace existential weight |
| Excessive emoji usage | Not premium |

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too Much Gold**: Gold is accent, not dominant. Use sparingly.
2. **Forgetting the Darkness**: If it doesn't feel atmospheric, add more shadow.
3. **Making Ika's Pink Dominant**: Her gradient is accent, not brand color.
4. **Generic Anime Style**: We're premium—every pixel should feel intentional.
5. **Copying Competitors**: We're NIKKE-adjacent, not a clone.

## Asset Creation Checklist

Before finalizing any visual asset, verify:

- [ ] Does it embody dark luxury?
- [ ] Is the color palette correct (black/gold primary)?
- [ ] Is typography appropriate for the context?
- [ ] Does composition feel premium and intentional?
- [ ] Would this fit alongside NIKKE marketing? (aspirational peer)
- [ ] Would this look out of place in Love Live marketing? (should feel alien there)
- [ ] Is there sufficient contrast for readability?
- [ ] Does it evoke the right emotional response?
- [ ] Is negative space used effectively?
- [ ] Could this be mistaken for a cheap mobile game? (if yes, redo it)
