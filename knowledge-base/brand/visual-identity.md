# Visual Identity - Infinite Idol Brand Guidelines

> *"Warm colors, dark stakes. The contrast is what makes it memorable."*

---

## Overview

Infinite Idol's visual identity embodies **premium but approachable**—a bright, vibrant aesthetic with warmth and polish that invites players in while the narrative delivers real stakes. We are pink and warm gold, soft lighting and celebration, elegance grounded in emotional weight.

This document defines the visual language of Infinite Idol across all touchpoints: game UI, marketing materials, social media assets, merchandise, and promotional content.

## Core Aesthetic Philosophy

### Premium But Approachable

This is our north star. Every visual decision flows from this principle.

| WE ARE | WE ARE NOT |
|--------|------------|
| Premium | Cheap |
| Warm and inviting | Cold and intimidating |
| Vibrant | Washed out |
| Cute with substance | Cute without depth |
| Blue Archive/Uma Musume tier | Generic mobile game |
| Pink and warm gold | Grey and sterile |
| Polished | Cluttered |
| Welcoming | Gatekeeping |

### The Emotional Core

Our visuals should evoke:

- **Warmth**: Inviting colors that draw players in, not push them away
- **Celebration**: Gift imagery, particles, moments of joy
- **Stakes**: The visual softness contrasts with narrative weight
- **Connection**: Personal, intimate, community-focused
- **Polish**: Every element feels crafted and intentional

### The Core Contrast

**The story is dark. The aesthetic is warm.** This contrast is what makes Infinite Idol work:

- Fading is permanent death → wrapped in soft pink hues
- Devotion is survival → expressed through warm celebration
- The Chase is life or death → presented with vibrant energy
- Stakes are existential → delivered with inviting visuals

This juxtaposition creates emotional impact. The warm aesthetics make the dark stakes hit harder.

## Color System

### Primary Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage | Meaning |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Ika Pink** | `#FF6B9D` | Primary brand color | Hope, energy, Ika's spirit |
| **Soft Coral** | `#FF8FA3` | Secondary pink, gradients | Warmth, approachability |
| **Sunset Gold** | `#FFB347` | Premium accents, celebrations | Success, aspiration, reward |
| **Warm Cream** | `#FFF5E6` | Light backgrounds, text | Softness, readability |

### Secondary Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage | Meaning |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Magenta** | `#FF2D7B` | Ika's signature gradient tip, emphasis | Passion, determination |
| **Ika Blue** | `#4DA6FF` | Accent color, Ika's eyes | Clarity, trust, contrast |
| **Deep Navy** | `#1A1A2E` | Dark backgrounds (warm tint) | Depth, nighttime, atmosphere |
| **Soft White** | `#FAFAFA` | Clean elements, highlights | Purity, clarity |

### Ika's Signature Gradient

Ika's hair gradient is sacred and must be consistent:

```
Rose Pink (#FF6B9D) → Magenta (#FF2D7B)
```

This gradient appears:
- In all Ika character art
- As accent gradients in Ika-focused content
- In the game UI when Ika is prominent
- **As a core element of our brand identity**

### Color Hierarchy

```
Background: 40% - Deep backgrounds with warm undertones OR light cream
Primary:    35% - Ika Pink / Soft Coral
Accent:     25% - Sunset Gold / Ika Blue
```

### Dark Backgrounds Done Right

When using dark backgrounds:
- Always add warm undertones (deep navy, not pure black)
- Use warm lighting effects (golden particles, pink glows)
- Ensure the overall feel is "nighttime celebration" not "cold void"
- Think: evening festival, not empty space

## What To Avoid

### Visual Don'ts

| NEVER DO | WHY |
|----------|-----|
| Pure black backgrounds without warmth | Feels cold and uninviting |
| Grey, sterile color schemes | Lacks personality |
| Busy, cluttered layouts | Cheap, amateur feeling |
| Harsh, dramatic lighting without softness | Intimidating, not welcoming |
| Washed out, desaturated palettes | Lacks energy and vibrancy |
| Generic stock photo aesthetic | We are crafted, not templated |
| Comic Sans or overly childish fonts | Undermines premium feel |
| Completely serious, no joy | Misses our warm aesthetic |

### Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting the Warmth**: If it feels cold or sterile, add warm lighting/colors.
2. **Overdoing the Dark**: Dark backgrounds need warm particles and glows.
3. **Missing Ika's Pink**: Our primary color should be prominent.
4. **Too Serious Visually**: The story is dark; the visuals should be warm.
5. **Cheap Execution**: We're Blue Archive tier—every pixel should feel polished.
