# TOKENOMICS - Economic Model & Currency Flow

> *"Devotion flows like currency—from fan to idol, from SUI to Gems, from Gems to glory. Every transaction is proof of belief. Every purchase, a declaration of loyalty to the Eternal Stage."*
> — Infinite Idol Economic Whitepaper

---

## Overview

The Infinite Idol economy is designed around a **single, stable conversion model** that rewards commitment while maintaining accessibility. This document details the complete economic flow: how real value enters the system, how it transforms into gameplay, and how it sustains the Eternal Stage.

Our tokenomics philosophy is **clarity over complexity**. No convoluted staking mechanisms, no yield farming distractions, no governance token drama. Just a clean, elegant system where Devotion translates directly into progression.

## Core Economic Model

### The Devotion Economy

```
Real World (SUI) → Game Economy (Gems) → Progression (Levels) → Status (Tiers)
```

| Stage | Currency | Function | Player Experience |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Entry** | SUI | Real value investment | Wallet transaction |
| **Conversion** | SUI → Gems | Value transformation | Instant gem credit |
| **Spending** | Gems | Progression fuel | Level ups, pets, events |
| **Status** | Levels | Social proof | Visible tier display |

### Base Conversion Rate

> **1 SUI = 100 Gems**

This fundamental rate is the anchor of the entire economy. It is:
- **Simple**: Easy mental math for players
- **Stable**: Not tied to market volatility
- **Transparent**: No hidden conversion fees

| **Dedicated** | 100 SUI | 10,000 | 15% | 1,500 | 11,500 | 115 Gems/SUI |
| **Collector** | 1,000 SUI | 100,000 | 20% | 20,000 | 120,000 | 120 Gems/SUI |

### Package Psychology

Each tier is designed for a specific player segment:

| Tier | Target Audience | Motivation | Barrier |
|------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Starter** | Curious newcomers | "Let me try this out" | Minimal |
| **Supporter** | Engaged casuals | "I like this, I'll invest more" | Low |
| **Dedicated** | Committed fans | "This is worth real money" | Moderate |
| **Collector** | Enthusiasts | "I want everything" | Significant |
| **Whale** | High spenders | "Status matters to me" | High |
| **Cosmic** | Ultimate devotees | "I will be legendary" | Very high |

### Bonus Escalation Logic

The bonus structure rewards higher commitment:

| Jump | Bonus Increase | Value Proposition |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1→10 SUI | +10% | First bonus—incentivizes commitment |
| 10→100 SUI | +5% | Incremental improvement |
| 100→1,000 SUI | +5% | Entering serious territory |
| 1,000→10,000 SUI | +5% | Whale threshold bonus |
| 10,000→100,000 SUI | +5% | Maximum dedication reward |

```

| Aspect | Details |

|--------|----------|--------|
| **Level Up** | 69 Gems | +1 Idol Aura Level |
| **Pet Egg Opening** | 420 Gems | Random pet NFT |
| **Special Events** | Variable | Event-specific rewards |

### Outflow: Treasury → Operations

```
Treasury → Multi-sig → Operational Accounts
               ↓
        Categorized Spending
```

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Development** | 40% | Game development, infrastructure |
| **Marketing** | 25% | Community growth, partnerships |
| **Team** | 20% | Salaries, contractors |

| **Emergency** | Temporary pause | Immediate (with explanation) |

### Inflation Control

|-----------|---------|
| **Fixed Level Cost** | 69 Gems always = 1 level |

*"They say money can't buy love. But in the world of idols? Money IS love. Every SUI you spend becomes gems. Every gem becomes a level. Every level keeps me from Fading. Your wallet isn't just a wallet—it's a lifeline. And I'll never forget who held it out to me."*
