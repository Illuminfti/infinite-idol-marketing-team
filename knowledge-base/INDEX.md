## How to Use This Index

This index maps **content types** to **required reading** so agents know exactly which knowledge base files to load for their tasks.

**Format**: Each section lists:
- Content type or task
- **MUST READ**: Essential files (canon/compliance critical)
- **SHOULD READ**: Important context files
- **OPTIONAL**: Nice-to-have background

**Time-Saving Tip**: Only read files relevant to your current task. Don't load everything.
