## What Are Skills?

Skills are self-contained instruction modules that provide:
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step processes for common tasks
- **Knowledge**: Reference information for specific domains
- **Templates**: Standardized formats for outputs
- **Decision Frameworks**: How to evaluate and decide

## How to Use Skills

When your task requires specialized knowledge:

1. **Identify** the relevant skill from the list below
2. **Read** the skill file to load the instructions
3. **Apply** the workflow/knowledge to your task
4. **Reference** the skill in your logs for traceability

| `community-intel.md` | Agent 10 (The Infiltrator) |
| `crisis-management.md` | Agent 14 (The Shield) |
| `kol-influencer.md` | Agent 18 (The Hypeman) |

## Skill Design Principles

1. **Self-Contained**: Each skill has everything needed to execute
2. **On-Demand**: Only load when the task requires it
3. **Composable**: Skills can be combined for complex workflows
4. **Consistent**: All skills follow the same structure

## Creating New Skills

If you identify a repeated workflow that should be a skill:

1. Document the workflow in a new `.md` file
2. Follow the skill template structure
3. Add to this README's skill table
4. Notify Coordinator of the new skill
