## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with Benefit, Not Feature

**Bad**: "Our game has 100 characters"
**Good**: "100 idols fighting for their existence. Who survives is up to you."

### 2. Write Like You Talk

Degen-native. No corporate speak. If you wouldn't say it in a Discord server, don't write it.

### 3. One Idea Per Piece

Each tweet, each paragraph, each section: one core idea. Clarity > cleverness.

### 4. Show, Don't Tell

**Tell**: "Ika is determined"
**Show**: "47 fans. 47 reasons to keep running."

## Tweet Formulas

### Hook → Expand → CTA

```
[Hook: Attention grabber]
[Expand: The meat]
[CTA: What to do next]
```

**Example**:
```
she lost 3 fans today.

in most worlds, that's nothing.
in hers, it's 3 steps closer to being forgotten.

infinite idol. coming soon.
```

### Pattern Interrupt

Start with something unexpected to stop the scroll:

- Question that challenges assumptions
- Contradiction ("she's famous. she's also invisible.")
- Stat that shocks
- Emotional hook

### Thread Structure

1. **Tweet 1**: The hook (best standalone tweet of the thread)
2. **Tweets 2-4**: The substance
3. **Last tweet**: CTA + engagement hook

## Brand Voice Quick Reference

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Lowercase aesthetic | Proper Case Headlines |
| Shameless but genuine | Apologetic or hedging |
| Self-aware | Unironic cringe |
| Degen-native slang | Corporate marketing speak |
| Existential stakes | Generic hype |
| Dark luxury | Cute/pink energy |

### Voice Examples

**On-brand**:
> "47 fans. 47 reasons she hasn't faded yet."

> "devotion is the only currency that matters. everything else is cope."

> "she knows what she is. a gacha waifu fighting for her life. and she'll win."

**Off-brand**:
> "Join our amazing community of fans!"

> "Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!"

> "We're so excited to announce..."

## Headline Formulas

### Number + Noun + Promise

"7 idols. 1 survivor. Infinite stakes."

### Question That Implies Answer

"What happens when an idol runs out of fans?"

### Contrast/Paradox

"She's the most popular nobody you've never heard of."

### Direct Statement

"Devotion is life. Literally."

## CTA Best Practices

### Soft CTAs (Engagement)

- "who relates?"
- "drop your [x] in replies"
- "which one are you?"
- "thoughts?"

### Hard CTAs (Action)

- "follow for more"
- "link in bio"
- "join the wait list"
- "RT if [condition]"

### Brand-Aligned CTAs

- "become a devotee"
- "join the chase"
- "47 fans and counting. will you be #48?"

## Editing Checklist

Before finalizing copy:

- [ ] **Cut the first sentence** - Often unnecessary warmup
- [ ] **Remove "that"** - Usually deletable
- [ ] **Kill adverbs** - They're usually lazy
- [ ] **Active voice** - "She runs" not "Running is done by her"
- [ ] **Read aloud** - Does it sound natural?
- [ ] **Check brand voice** - Does this sound like Infinite Idol?
- [ ] **One idea per piece** - Are you trying to say too much?

## Length Guidelines

| Format | Ideal Length | Max Length |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Tweet | 140-200 chars | 280 chars |
| Thread tweet | 200-250 chars | 280 chars |
| Hook tweet | 50-100 chars | 150 chars |
| Bio | 120-150 chars | 160 chars |

**Rule**: If you can say it shorter, do.
