## The Speed Imperative

CT trends have a **half-life of 2-4 hours**. By the time you've done a full review cycle, the moment has passed. This skill provides frameworks for rapid content creation while maintaining brand safety.

**Core Principle**: Speed over perfection, but never over safety.

└── NO → Continue

Are we being asked to comment?
├── YES → "we're focused on building. that's the tweet."
└── NO → Continue

Is there a non-controversial angle?
├── YES → Light observation, don't take sides
└── NO → SILENCE (best response)
```

**Default Response**: Don't engage with drama unless directly involved.

**Response Framework**:
```
[Trending topic] + [Creative tie-in to our world]

## Rapid Response Workflow

### Step-by-Step

```
1. EVENT DETECTED
   └── Agent 00 or Agent 09 identifies opportunity

2. CLASSIFICATION (2 min)
   └── Which template applies?
   └── CT Express eligible?
   └── Time sensitivity?

3. DRAFT (10-15 min)
   └── Agent 02 creates content
   └── Uses relevant template
   └── Targets appropriate DS

4. CULTURAL CHECK (5-10 min)
   └── Agent 09 reviews
   └── DS appropriate?
   └── Ratio risk?
   └── Brand safe?

5. EXECUTE (immediate)
   └── Agent 00 approves
   └── Content posted
   └── Monitor initial response

6. FOLLOW-UP (30 min post)
   └── Engage with good replies
   └── Monitor for issues
   └── Log performance
```

### Parallel Processing

For maximum speed, some steps can overlap:

```
Agent 09 monitors CT → Spots trend → Alerts team
        ↓ (simultaneously)
Agent 02 starts drafting while Agent 09 assesses trend legitimacy
        ↓
Both review draft together
        ↓
Post
```

## Response Kill Switches

### DO NOT RESPOND to:

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Active controversy about us | Needs full review |
| Legal/financial implications | Liability risk |
| Personal attacks on team | Don't feed trolls |
| Competitor direct comparison asks | Trap |
| Requests for alpha/leaks | Premature info |
| Political topics | Brand risk |
| Ongoing investigations | Legal risk |

### PAUSE AND ESCALATE if:

- Response could be seen as financial advice
- Response involves unreleased information
- Response could be screenshot weaponized
- Response touches Inviolable Facts
- Unsure about anything

---

## Quality Checklist (30-Second Version)

Before posting rapid response:

- [ ] Does this sound like us?
- [ ] Would I be embarrassed tomorrow?
- [ ] Is this punching up, not down?
- [ ] Is the timing right (trend still alive)?
- [ ] Is this adding value or just noise?

If any doubt → Don't post. Better to miss a trend than damage brand.

---

## Post-Response Protocol

### Immediate (0-30 min)

1. Monitor initial engagement
2. Respond to quality replies
3. Watch for misinterpretation
4. Be ready to clarify if needed

### Short-term (30 min - 2 hours)

1. Assess performance vs. expectations
2. Log in session memory
3. Note learnings for future

### If Response Goes Wrong

1. **Don't panic delete** (Streisand effect)
2. **Assess damage** (ratio? misread? offensive?)
3. **Clarify if misunderstood** ("to clarify: [intent]")
4. **Apologize if warranted** (genuine, not corporate)
5. **Move on** (next content buries it)

---

## Response Time Tracking

Log every rapid response:

```markdown
## Rapid Response Log

## Emergency Contacts

For situations requiring human escalation:

| Potential crisis | Human immediately | Do not post |
| Legal question | Human immediately | Do not post |
| Unsure about anything | Human | Wait for guidance |
