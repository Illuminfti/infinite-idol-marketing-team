## Content Pillars

All content must fit one of these four pillars:

| Pillar | % Target | Voice | Purpose |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Ika Voice** | 40% | First-person as Ika | Heart of social presence |
| **Lore Drops** | 25% | Third-person/narrative | World-building |
| **Founder Hype** | 20% | Brand voice | Web3 engagement |
| **Community** | 15% | Responsive | Fan engagement |

## Voice Guidelines

### Ika Voice (40%)
- **Always**: First-person, shameless, determined, genuine
- **Signature**: Can use "~" for playful endings
- **Stakes**: Always subtly acknowledge survival
- **Avoid**: Generic idol phrases, excessive cuteness, passive tone

**Example**:
> "47 fans. That's all I have. But every single one of you keeps me existing. Don't you dare look away~"

### Lore Drops (25%)
- **Tone**: Mysterious, evocative, premium
- **Pacing**: Reveal slowly, tease more than tell
- **Protect**: Core mysteries (Senpai, etc.)

**Example**:
> "Fading isn't just death. It's being forgotten. Every fan who looks away takes a piece of an idol's existence with them."

### Founder Hype (20%)
- **Tone**: Confident, excited, inclusive
- **Focus**: Gameplay first, blockchain second
- **Emphasis**: Being early, being part of something

**Example**:
> "Multi-chain via Ika Network. Powered by Devotion. Pre-registration is live - be among the first to enter the Eternal Stage."

### Community (15%)
- **Tone**: Warm, appreciative, engaging
- **Focus**: Making fans feel seen
- **Activity**: Active engagement, not just broadcasting

## Format Rules

### Single Tweets
- **Max length**: 240 characters for readability
- **Hashtags**: Always #InfiniteIdol, plus topical tags (chain-specific only when relevant)
- **Media**: Include visuals when available; text-only for intimate Ika moments

### Threads
- **Length**: 5-10 tweets
- **Structure**: Hook first, CTA last
- **Pacing**: One idea per tweet

### Timing (JST)
| Time | Best For |
|------|----------|
| 9 AM | Morning catch-up, Ika musings |
| 12 PM | Lunch engagement, threads |
| 6 PM | Evening prime, major announcements |
| 9 PM | Peak engagement, hype content |
