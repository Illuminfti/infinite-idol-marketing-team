# Crisis Management Protocol
## Infinite Idol Marketing Team

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Owner**: Agent 00 (Coordinator)
**Authority**: All agents must follow this protocol

---

## Purpose

This protocol defines how the Infinite Idol marketing team responds to content crises: viral backlash, canon violations discovered post-publication, community sentiment crashes, or brand reputation threats.

---

## Severity Classification

### Level 1: MINOR (Isolated Negative Feedback)
**Indicators**:
- Negative comments on single post (<10 comments)
- Mild criticism or disagreement
- Questions about canon/mechanics
- No spreading beyond original post

**Response Time**: Within 4 hours
**Handler**: Agent 03 (Community Manager) + originating content agent

### Level 2: MAJOR (Significant Backlash)
**Indicators**:
- Post getting "ratio'd" (more replies than likes/retweets)
- Multiple community members expressing concern
- Spreading to other threads/Discord channels
- Potential canon violation discovered
- 20%+ drop in engagement metrics

**Response Time**: Within 2 hours
**Handler**: Agent 00 (Coordinator) + Agent 09 (Degen) + Agent 03

### Level 3: CRITICAL (Brand Threat)
**Indicators**:
- Viral negative attention (>100 negative engagements)
- Major canon violation confirmed post-publication
- Community moderators/influencers criticizing
- Spreading to other communities (Reddit, Discord servers)
- Breaking Inviolable Facts publicly
- Legal/compliance concerns

**Response Time**: Immediate (within 30 minutes)
**Handler**: Human escalation required + Agent 00 + Agent 09

---

## Detection Mechanisms

### Automated Monitoring (Agent 03 + Agent 05)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track comment/reply tone on all published content
- **Engagement Drops**: Alert if post performs 30% below baseline
- **Ratio Detection**: Flag posts where replies exceed likes by 2x
- **Community Pulse**: Monitor Discord sentiment daily
- **Competitor Watch**: Track if competitors/critics mention us

### Escalation Triggers
| Metric | Minor | Major | Critical |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Negative Comments | 5-10 | 10-50 | 50+ |
| Engagement Drop | 10-20% | 20-40% | 40%+ |
| Reply/Like Ratio | 1.0-1.5x | 1.5-3x | 3x+ |
| Community Spread | Single thread | Multiple threads | Cross-platform |
| Canon Violation | Possible | Likely | Confirmed |

---

## Response Procedures

### LEVEL 1: Minor Response

**Step 1: Assessment (Agent 03)**
- Read all negative comments/feedback
- Classify criticism type:
  - Canon question (needs clarification)
  - Mechanics confusion (needs explanation)
  - Tone/voice concern (cultural mismatch)
  - General negativity (subjective opinion)
- Document in `/logs/crisis-log.md`

**Step 2: Response (Agent 03 + Originating Agent)**
- **Canon questions**: Provide clarification with references
- **Mechanics confusion**: Offer explanation, consider FAQ addition
- **Tone concerns**: Acknowledge feedback, maintain brand voice
- **General negativity**: Engage respectfully or strategic silence

**Step 3: Follow-Up**
- Monitor for 24 hours
- If escalates → upgrade to Level 2
- If resolves → document lesson learned

**Example Response Templates**:
```
Canon Question Response:
"Great question! [Clarification with canon reference]. The [mechanic/character]
works this way because [reason]. Let us know if that helps!"

Tone Concern Response:
"We hear you. Our voice is intentionally [bold/shameless/dark luxury] because
[brand reason]. Not everyone's vibe, and that's okay. Appreciate the feedback."
```

---

### LEVEL 2: Major Response

**Step 1: Emergency Assessment (Agent 00 + Agent 09 + Agent 03)**
- **Within 30 minutes**: Full situation analysis
- Identify root cause:
  - Cultural misread (DS calibration off)
  - Canon inconsistency
  - Poor timing/context
  - Genuine mistake
- Review original content creation + approval process
- Determine if content should be:
  - Left as-is with clarification
  - Corrected with follow-up
  - Removed entirely

**Step 2: Response Strategy (Agent 00 + Agent 09)**
- **If cultural misread**: Agent 09 drafts correction/clarification
- **If canon issue**: Agent 08 validates, Agent 01 approves correction
- **If timing/context**: Agent 02 drafts contextual follow-up
- All responses reviewed by Agent 09 for cultural tone

**Step 3: Execution**
- Post clarification/correction within 2 hours of detection
- Acknowledge mistake if genuine error (shameless but genuine)
- Provide correct information
- Update internal guidelines to prevent recurrence

**Step 4: Damage Control**
- Agent 03 monitors sentiment for 48 hours
- Prepare positive content to rebuild momentum
- Schedule "palate cleanser" content (high-confidence Ika voice or lore drop)

**Example Correction Tweet**:
```
"Quick correction on [topic]: [Accurate information]. Our bad on the confusion.
Here's the real deal: [Explanation].

Thanks for keeping us honest 🖤

(And yes, we know - we're still figuring this out. 47 fans and learning.)"
```

---

### LEVEL 3: Critical Response

**Step 1: IMMEDIATE Human Escalation**
- **Agent 00**: Notify human operator within 15 minutes
- **All agents**: Halt new content publication until resolved
- **Agent 05**: Compile full metrics (engagement, spread, sentiment)
- **Agent 09**: Assess cultural/brand damage severity

**Step 2: Human-Led Response Strategy**
- Human reviews situation with Agent 00 + Agent 09 input
- Determine severity of canon violation or brand damage
- Options:
  1. **Public Apology + Correction** (for factual errors)
  2. **Content Removal + Explanation** (for major canon breaks)
  3. **Strategic Silence** (if engagement would amplify)
  4. **Community Address** (for serious concerns)

**Step 3: Execute Human Decision**
- Agents execute approved response plan
- All new content reviewed by human before publication (temporary)
- Agent 08 adds violated canon to enhanced validation checklist

**Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**
- Full review of approval chain that missed issue
- Update agent guidelines/skills to prevent recurrence
- Document in `/knowledge-base/lessons-learned.md`
- Consider agent calibration session if needed

**Step 5: Rebuilding Phase**
- Agent 02 + Agent 09: Create confidence-rebuilding content
- Agent 03: Enhanced community engagement
- Agent 05: Track recovery metrics
- Return to normal operations when sentiment stabilizes (>80% baseline)

## Canon Violation Post-Publication Protocol

### Minor Violations (Typos, Inconsistencies)
**Examples**: Character name spelling, minor timeline inconsistency, cosmetic detail mismatch

**Response**:
1. Document violation in `/logs/canon-corrections.md`
2. Issue correction tweet if appropriate
3. Update future content to use correct information
4. Add to Agent 08 validation checklist

**Template**:
```
"Correction: [Character/Detail] is [Correct info], not [Incorrect info]
as we said earlier. Canon is sacred - thanks for catching that."
```

### Major Violations (Breaks Tier 1-3 Canon)
**Examples**: Contradicts Inviolable Fact, breaks character profile, violates published novel canon

**Response**:
1. **IMMEDIATE ESCALATION** to human
2. Consider content removal if violation is severe
3. Public acknowledgment if community has noticed
4. Full investigation of approval chain failure
5. Update agent training to prevent recurrence

**Template** (Human-approved):
```
"We messed up. [Explanation of violation]. Here's what actually happens: [Correct canon].

This is on us - we have rigorous canon protection for a reason. Back to the drawing board
on this one. The world is too important to get sloppy."
```

### Handling Community-Discovered Violations
- **Acknowledge quickly** (within 2 hours)
- **Thank reporter** (community helps maintain canon)
- **Correct publicly** (transparency builds trust)
- **Update internally** (prevent future violations)

---

## Communication Templates

### Acknowledgment (Minor Issues)
```
"Thanks for the feedback. We're looking into this and will follow up shortly."
```

### Clarification (Confusion, Not Error)
```
"Let us clarify: [Explanation]. Hope that helps! Reach out if you have more questions."
```

### Correction (Our Mistake)
```
"You're right - we got this wrong. [Correct information]. Thanks for keeping us honest."
```

### Apology (Significant Error)
```
"We messed up on this one. [Explanation of error]. Here's what we should have said: [Correction].

We hold ourselves to high standards, and this didn't meet them. Learning and improving."
```

### Strategic Silence (When Response Would Amplify)
- No public response
- Internal documentation
- Monitor for escalation
- Private outreach to key community members if needed

## Recovery Metrics
