## Degen Authenticity Matrix

Rate content on four axes (1-10 each):

| Axis | Low (1-3) | High (8-10) |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Shamelessness** | Apologetic, hedging, corporate | Bold, unapologetic, owns it |
| **Self-Awareness** | Unironically cringe | Knows what it is, embraces it |
| **Cultural Relevance** | Stale, outdated, forced | Fresh, timely, natural |
| **Degen Energy** | Safe, normie, sanitized | Edgy, provocative, authentic |

### Scoring Verdicts

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 32-40 | **ASCENDED** | Ship + flag for amplification |
| 24-31 | **BASED** | Ship, no changes |
| 16-23 | **MID** | Needs improvement |
| 8-15 | **CRINGE** | Significant revision |

## Review Process

### Step 1: First Impression
Ask yourself:
- Does this make us look like "fellow kids"?
- Would this get ratio'd on CT?
- Would I share this?

### Step 2: Reference Check
For any memes, trends, or cultural references:
- Is this still fresh or played out?
- Is it being used correctly?
- Is it appropriate for the platform?

### Step 3: Apply Matrix
Score each axis, sum for verdict.
