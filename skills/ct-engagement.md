## The CT Domination Philosophy

CT is not social media. CT is a **24/7 global arena** where reputations are built, tokens are discovered, and communities form overnight. To win on CT:

1. **Be native** - Speak like you live here, not like you're visiting
2. **Add value** - Every post should entertain, inform, or provoke thought
3. **Move fast** - Trends die in hours, not days
4. **Build relationships** - CT is a network graph, not a broadcast channel

## Reply Guy Protocol

> *"The fastest way to grow on CT isn't posting—it's replying."*

### Why Replies Work

- Your reply appears to the original poster's entire audience
- High-quality replies get pinned, quoted, and remembered
- You build relationships with accounts larger than yours
- The algorithm rewards engagement

### Target Account Tiers

| Tier | Follower Range | Strategy |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Whale** | 100k+ | Thoughtful, valuable adds only. Quality over frequency. |
| **Big Fish** | 20k-100k | Regular engagement, build recognition |
| **Peer** | 5k-20k | Mutual support, collaboration opportunities |
| **Rising** | 1k-5k | Early relationship building |

### Reply Formulas That Work

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Value Add** | Expand on their point | "This. And the second-order effect is..." |
| **Contrarian** | Respectful disagreement | "Interesting take. Counter-argument: ..." |
| **Data Drop** | Add relevant facts | "Numbers to back this: [stat]" |
| **Experience** | Personal relevance | "We saw this exact pattern when..." |
| **Humor** | On-brand wit | "The virgin [X] vs the chad [Y]" |
| **Question** | Engagement bait | "Genuine question: what about [edge case]?" |

### Reply DON'Ts

- Never shill your project in unrelated threads
- Never reply with just "This" or "So true"
- Never argue aggressively (ratio bait)
- Never reply to every post from same account (stalker energy)
- Never copy someone else's successful reply format exactly

### Daily Reply Targets

| Day Type | Target Replies | Focus |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Normal** | 10-15 | Mix of tiers, value-first |
| **Trending Event** | 20-30 | Concentrate on trending topics |
| **Quiet Day** | 5-10 | Quality over quantity |

## Thread Architecture

### Thread Anatomy

```
Tweet 1: THE HOOK (best standalone tweet - this is what gets RT'd)
    ↓
Tweet 2-3: THE SETUP (context, stakes, problem)
    ↓
Tweet 4-6: THE MEAT (insights, value, information)
    ↓
Tweet 7-8: THE PAYOFF (conclusion, revelation)
    ↓
Tweet 9: THE CTA (engagement prompt + follow request)
```

### Hook Types That Convert

| Hook Type | Example | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Contrarian** | "Hot take: [opinion most disagree with]" | Engagement, discussion |
| **Number** | "7 things I learned from [X]" | Save-worthy content |
| **Story** | "A thread about the time [dramatic event]" | Narrative content |
| **Mystery** | "Most people don't know this about [X]" | Curiosity gap |
| **Direct** | "Let me tell you about [topic]" | Authority building |
| **Question** | "Why does [thing] happen?" | Educational content |

### Thread Templates

#### Lore Drop Thread
```
1. Hook: "[Mystery element] has been hiding in plain sight."
2. Setup: "In Infinite Idol, [basic context]"
3-6. Reveals: [New information, building]
7. Payoff: "And that's why [dramatic conclusion]"
8. CTA: "What else do you want to know? 👇"
```

#### Character Introduction Thread
```
1. Hook: "[Character name]. [Dramatic one-liner]"
2. Stat block: Fans, Rank, Signature trait
3-5. Story: Origin, motivation, current state
6. Voice sample: First-person quote
7. CTA: "Would you become their fan?"
```

#### Founder Update Thread
```
1. Hook: "We just did [thing]. Here's why it matters."
2-3. Context: What happened, what it means
4-5. Vision: Where this leads
6. Community: How this helps fans
7. CTA: "This is just the beginning. Stay tuned."
```

### Recurring Events

| Event | Timing | Content Strategy |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **gm posts** | Daily, morning | Simple engagement, community warmth |

| **Sunday reflects** | Sundays | Week recap, community highlights |
| **Month-end** | Last day | Monthly recap, metrics flex |

### Crypto-Specific Events

| Event | Strategy |

| **Token launches** | Commentary (not shilling), relate to our narrative |
| **Market crashes** | "Anyway, here's idol content" energy |
| **Major project news** | Thoughtful takes if relevant, ignore if not |

## DS Calibration for CT

CT runs hotter than other platforms. Recalibrate:

| Standard DS | CT-Adjusted DS | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| DS-2 | Too cold | Will feel corporate on CT |
| DS-2.5 | Minimum | Acceptable for announcements |
| DS-3 | Target | Sweet spot for most content |
| DS-3.5 | Peak | For engagement bait, Ika voice |
| DS-4 | Ceiling | Risk of ratio, use carefully |

### CT-Specific Red Flags

| Red Flag | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| "We're excited to announce..." | Corporate buzzword instant skip |
| Hashtag stuffing | Looks desperate |
| Thread without hook | Nobody reads past tweet 1 |
| Replying "Thanks!" to every comment | Bot behavior |
| Posting at dead hours | Wasted content |
| Taking obvious bait | Feeds trolls |

### CT-Specific Green Flags

| Green Flag | Why It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| Self-deprecating humor | Shows self-awareness |
| Inside jokes with community | Rewards loyal followers |
| Quote-tweeting with take | Adds value, not just amplifies |
| Admitting mistakes openly | Builds trust |
| Engaging with critics fairly | Shows confidence |

### Explicit Content Restrictions

**DO NOT use the following in CT content:**

| Restricted | Reason | Alternative |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **"47 fans" as anchor** | Specific number is nonsensical, not core lore | Use general "low-ranked", "underdog", "struggling idol" framing |
| **Price action/token price** | Not our focus, avoid shilling | Focus on game, lore, community |
| **$SUI promotion** | We don't push Sui blockchain | Only reference Sui through character **Sheran** |
| **"SUI is great/fast/etc"** | Tech shilling | Character-based references only |
| **FOMO on token/price** | Not our energy | Focus on game FOMO (events, content) |

**SUI/Blockchain References**:
- Only mention Sui in relation to the character **Sheran** (not the technology)
- No chain comparisons or tech superiority claims
- Gameplay first, blockchain invisible

**Fan Count Framing**:
- Use "struggling idol" not specific numbers
- "Low-ranked" instead of exact counts
- "Underdog" instead of quantified disadvantage
- The Devotion system matters, specific numbers don't

## Quote Tweet Strategy

Quote tweets are **content + distribution** combined.

### When to Quote Tweet

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Relevant news | Add our take, tie to our narrative |
| Community content | Celebrate and amplify (with permission vibe) |
| Competitor content | Only if we can add genuine value |
| Viral content | Only if truly relevant, not clout chasing |

### Quote Tweet Formulas

| Type | Formula |
|------|---------|
| **The Add** | [Original] + "And here's the part most people miss:" |
| **The Relate** | [Original] + "This is exactly why we built [X]" |
| **The Counter** | [Original] + "Interesting but consider [alternative]" |
| **The Celebrate** | [Original] + "This. More of this." |

## Ratio Risk Assessment

Before posting, ask:

1. **Is this punching down?** → Don't post
2. **Could this be misread as serious?** → Add clarity or don't post
3. **Are we picking a fight we can't win?** → Don't post
4. **Does this make us look defensive?** → Reframe or don't post
5. **Would Ika say this?** → If no, reconsider

### Ratio Recovery

If ratio'd:
1. **Don't delete** (unless factually wrong or harmful)
2. **Don't argue** (feeds the ratio)
3. **Acknowledge if fair criticism** ("fair point, we'll think on this")
4. **Move on quickly** (next good content buries it)

## X Algorithm Optimization

*Based on xAI's open-source algorithm release (January 2026)*

### How the X Algorithm Works

X's "For You" feed is powered by **Grok** (xAI's transformer model). It combines:
1. **In-network content** (from accounts you follow)
2. **Out-of-network content** (ML-discovered content)

The algorithm predicts engagement probability and ranks posts accordingly.

**Source**: [xAI X-Algorithm GitHub](https://github.com/xai-org/x-algorithm)

### Engagement Signal Weights

| Action | Weight | Strategy Implication |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Reply + author engages back** | +75 | HIGHEST VALUE - Get conversations going |
| **Reply** | +13.5 | Replies >> likes |
| **Open profile + like/reply** | +12 | Profile visits are valuable |
| **Click conversation + engage** | +11 | Thread engagement matters |
| **Stay in convo 2+ min** | +10 | Long-form hooks work |
| **Retweet** | +1.0 | Shares still valuable |
| **Like** | +0.5 | Likes are LOW value |
| **Watch 50%+ of video** | +0.005 | Video completion signals quality |

**Key Insight**: Replies are worth **27x more than likes**. Optimize for conversation, not just hearts.

### The 30-Minute Window

The algorithm evaluates **engagement velocity in the first 30 minutes**. This window is critical:

1. **Post when audience is active** (9AM-12PM weekdays, especially Wed/Fri)
2. **Engage immediately with early replies** (+75 if you reply back)
3. **Front-load hooks** to stop scrolling
4. **Avoid posting into dead hours**

### Premium Subscriber Advantage

X Premium subscribers receive:
- **4x boost** for in-network content
- **2x boost** for out-of-network content
- Priority placement in replies and search

*Recommendation*: Consider Premium for brand account.

### What Gets Penalized

| Penalty | Impact | Avoid |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Bare links | -80% reach | Add context, don't just drop URLs |
| External links | Deboosted | Use native content, link in replies |
| "Offensive" text | -80% reach | DS-4 territory, pull back |
| Blocks/mutes from viewers | Negative score | Don't alienate, build community |
| Engagement bait without payoff | Hidden | Deliver on hooks |

### Algorithm-Optimized Content Strategy

#### Optimize for Replies, Not Likes

| Old Strategy | New Strategy |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Like if you agree" | "Reply with your take" |
| Standalone statement | Question that invites response |
| One-way content | Conversation starters |

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Ika is the best idol. Like if you agree."
- ✅ "Ika vs [competitor]. Who wins and why? Wrong answers encouraged."

#### Thread Structure for Algorithm

```
Tweet 1: Hook (stop scroll, provoke curiosity)
    ↓ Algorithm checks: Did they stop? Did they click?
Tweet 2-3: Setup (build investment)
    ↓ Algorithm checks: Still reading? Time on thread?
Tweet 4-6: Value (the meat, share-worthy insights)
    ↓ Algorithm checks: Replies? Quotes?
Tweet 7: CTA (invite reply specifically)
    ↓ Algorithm checks: Conversation started?
```

#### Video Optimization

- **Upload native** (not YouTube links)
- **Under 2:20** optimal length
- **Hook in first 3 seconds** (watch time matters)
- **No external platform mentions** (TikTok, IG)

### Promptable Feed Awareness

Users can now prompt X with natural language ("show me more tech, less politics"). This means:

- **Niche down** - Be clearly identifiable as gacha/crypto/idol content
- **Consistent themes** - Algorithm learns to categorize you
- **Avoid topic drift** - Stay in your lane for algorithm clarity

### Daily Algorithm Optimization Checklist

Before posting:
- [ ] Is this posted in the 30-min active window?
- [ ] Does this invite replies, not just likes?
- [ ] Are links in replies, not main post?
- [ ] Is video native and under 2:20?
- [ ] Does hook stop the scroll in 3 seconds?

After posting (first 30 min):
- [ ] Engage with every reply (+75 boost)
- [ ] Quote interesting replies to continue conversation
- [ ] Don't abandon the thread
