## Core Principle

The Infinite Idol brand has **one identity** but **many expressions**. Adaptation is not dilution—it's translation. The core pillars remain constant; the intensity and style adjust to context.

| **Dark luxury aesthetic** | Black/gold, never pink/cutesy |
| **Existential stakes** | Devotion = survival, always |
| **Self-awareness** | We know what we are |
| **Authenticity** | Shameless but genuine |

## Adaptation Variables
