All content is provided in the `FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` source document - no external research or integrations needed. The complexity lies in **volume** (55 files, 30 directories) rather than technical difficulty.\n\n### Key Analysis Points\n\n| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |\n|-----------|------------|-------|\n| **Scope** | 55 files, 1 service | Large volume but contained to single repository |\n| **Integrations** | None | Pure content creation from specifications |\n| **Infrastructure** | None | Just folder structure, no Docker/DB/config |\n| **Knowledge** | All provided | Every piece of content is in the source document |\n| **Risk** | Low | Creating new files in empty repo, nothing to break |\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n```\ndiscovery → requirements → context → spec_writing → planning → validation\n```\n(6 phases - standard workflow without research or self-critique)\n\n### Validation\n- **Risk Level**: Low\n- **Minimal Mode**: Yes\n- **Test Types**: None (content creation, not code)\n- **Security Scan**: Not required (markdown files only)\n\n### Task Components\n1. Repository folder structure (30 directories)\n2. Core files (CLAUDE.md, README.md)\n3. 7 agent persona files\n4. 15+ lore/character files\n5. 5 game mechanics files\n6. 4 brand guideline files\n7. Output directories with .gitkeep\n8. Logs and review templates",

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge.

Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge. The kind that she somehow knew, instinctively, she had never once apologized for.\n    45→\n    46→*I can work with this,* she thought, and somewhere in her swiss-cheese memory, that felt RIGHT.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## THE WORLD OF INFINITE IDOL\n    51→\n    52→### DEVOTION (OR: SIMPING AS A POWER SOURCE)\n    53→\n    54→When audiences experience intense emotions—excitement, desire, awe, the specific brain-melt that happens when someone attractive does something athletic—something happens. Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to
