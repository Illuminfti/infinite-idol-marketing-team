All content is provided in the `FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` source document - no external research or integrations needed. The complexity lies in **volume** (55 files, 30 directories) rather than technical difficulty.\n\n### Key Analysis Points\n\n| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |\n|-----------|------------|-------|\n| **Scope** | 55 files, 1 service | Large volume but contained to single repository |\n| **Integrations** | None | Pure content creation from specifications |\n| **Infrastructure** | None | Just folder structure, no Docker/DB/config |\n| **Knowledge** | All provided | Every piece of content is in the source document |\n| **Risk** | Low | Creating new files in empty repo, nothing to break |\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n```\ndiscovery → requirements → context → spec_writing → planning → validation\n```\n(6 phases - standard workflow without research or self-critique)\n\n### Validation\n- **Risk Level**: Low\n- **Minimal Mode**: Yes\n- **Test Types**: None (content creation, not code)\n- **Security Scan**: Not required (markdown files only)\n\n### Task Components\n1. Repository folder structure (30 directories)\n2. Core files (CLAUDE.md, README.md)\n3. 7 agent persona files\n4. 15+ lore/character files\n5. 5 game mechanics files\n6. 4 brand guideline files\n7. Output directories with .gitkeep\n8. Logs and review templates",

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge.

Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge. The kind that she somehow knew, instinctively, she had never once apologized for.\n    45→\n    46→*I can work with this,* she thought, and somewhere in her swiss-cheese memory, that felt RIGHT.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## THE WORLD OF INFINITE IDOL\n    51→\n    52→### DEVOTION (OR: SIMPING AS A POWER SOURCE)\n    53→\n    54→When audiences experience intense emotions—excitement, desire, awe, the specific brain-melt that happens when someone attractive does something athletic—something happens. Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to Modify\n    60→\n    61→This is a greenfield setup - no existing files to modify.\n    62→\n    63→## Files to Create\n    64→\n    65→| File | Directory | What to Create |\n

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→##

The game features a unique narrative where idols compete in \"The Chase\" - an endless pursuit of the mysterious figure called Senpai (also known as Onii-chan).\n    10→\n    11→### Core Premise\n    12→\n    13→In the world of Infinite Idol, idols are powered by **Devotion** - literal emotional energy from their fans. Without fans, idols experience **Fading** - they cease to exist. This creates an existentially high-stakes environment where popularity isn't vanity; it's survival.\n    14→\n    15→### Brand Positioning\n    16→\n    17→- **Dark Luxury**: Premium aesthetic with black and gold tones. NOT cutesy pink idol aesthetics.\n    18→- **Self-Aware**: We know we're making a gacha game. We're shameless about it but genuine in our craft.\n    19→- **Existentially Dramatic**: The stakes are real (within the narrative). Every Chase matters.\n    20→- **Web3 Native**: Built on SUI, but gameplay comes first. We're not \"crypto game\" - we're a great game that happens to use blockchain.\n    21→\n    22→---\n    23→\n    24→## The Agent System\n    25→\n    26→This repository is managed by a team of 7 specialized AI agents, coordinated to handle all aspects of marketing for Infinite Idol.

Devotion is Literal\n   187→\n   188→Devotion is the **literal emotional energy** fans invest in idols. It is not metaphorical. Idols can feel it, use it, and are sustained by it.

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to Modify\n    60→\n    61→This is a greenfield setup - no existing files to modify.\n    62→\n    63→## Files to Create\n    64→\n    65→| File | Directory | What to Create |\n

Every agent session should begin by reading this file completely.\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Project Overview\n     8→\n     9→**Infinite Idol** is a Web3 gacha game combining anime idol aesthetics with blockchain technology on the **SUI** blockchain. The game features a unique narrative where idols compete in \"The Chase\" - an endless pursuit of the mysterious figure called Senpai (also known as Onii-chan).\n    10→\n    11→### Core Premise\n    12→\n    13→In the world of Infinite Idol, idols are powered by **Devotion** - literal emotional energy from their fans. Without fans, idols experience **Fading** - they cease to exist. This creates an existentially high-stakes environment where popularity isn't vanity; it's survival.\n    14→\n    15→### Brand Positioning\n    16→\n    17→- **Dark Luxury**: Premium aesthetic with black and gold tones. NOT cutesy pink idol aesthetics.\n    18→- **Self-Aware**: We know we're making a gacha game. We're shameless about it but genuine in our craft.\n    19→- **Existentially Dramatic**: The stakes are real (within the narrative). Every Chase matters.\n    20→- **Web3 Native**: Built on SUI, but gameplay comes first.

Devotion is Literal\n   187→\n   188→Devotion is the **literal emotional energy** fans invest in idols. It is not metaphorical. Idols can feel it, use it, and are sustained by it. Without Devotion, idols Fade.\n   189→\n   190→### 2. Fading is Death\n   191→\n   192→When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they **Fade**. Fading is functionally death - the idol ceases to exist. There is no known way to reverse Fading.\n   193→\n   194→### 3. Ika Has 47 Fans\n   195→\n   196→Ika Minami starts her journey with exactly **47 fans**. This is a dangerously low number. Most idols have thousands at minimum. This is her defining underdog status.\n   197→\n   198→### 4. Ika's Hair is Pink Gradient\n   199→\n   200→Ika's hair color is a **pink gradient**: rose pink at the roots fading to magenta at the tips.

Senpai is Always Obscured\n   203→\n   204→**Senpai** (also called **Onii-chan**) is the figure all idols chase in The Chase. Senpai's face is NEVER shown.

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge. The kind that she somehow knew, instinctively, she had never once apologized for.\n    45→\n    46→*I can work with this,* she thought, and somewhere in her swiss-cheese memory, that felt RIGHT.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## THE WORLD OF INFINITE IDOL\n    51→\n    52→### DEVOTION (OR: SIMPING AS A POWER SOURCE)\n    53→\n    54→When audiences experience intense emotions—excitement, desire, awe, the specific brain-melt that happens when someone attractive does something athletic—something happens. Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

Every agent session should begin by reading this file completely.\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Project Overview\n     8→\n     9→**Infinite Idol** is a Web3 gacha game combining anime idol aesthetics with blockchain technology on the **SUI** blockchain. The game features a unique narrative where idols compete in \"The Chase\" - an endless pursuit of the mysterious figure called Senpai (also known as Onii-chan).\n    10→\n    11→### Core Premise\n    12→\n    13→In the world of Infinite Idol, idols are powered by **Devotion** - literal emotional energy from their fans. Without fans, idols experience **Fading** - they cease to exist. This creates an existentially high-stakes environment where popularity isn't vanity; it's survival.\n    14→\n    15→### Brand Positioning\n    16→\n    17→- **Dark Luxury**: Premium aesthetic with black and gold tones. NOT cutesy pink idol aesthetics.\n    18→- **Self-Aware**: We know we're making a gacha game. We're shameless about it but genuine in our craft.\n    19→- **Existentially Dramatic**: The stakes are real (within the narrative). Every Chase matters.\n    20→- **Web3 Native**: Built on SUI, but gameplay comes first. We're not \"crypto game\" - we're a great game that happens to use blockchain.\n    21→\n    22→---\n    23→\n    24→## The Agent System\n    25→\n    26→This repository is managed by a team of 7 specialized AI agents, coordinated to handle all aspects of marketing for Infinite Idol.

Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## The Eternal Stage\n    16→\n    17→### What It Is\n    18→\n    19→The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Devotion\n    35→\n    36→### Definition\n    37→\n    38→**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols.

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md

characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→##

She's doing it anyway.\n    77→\n    78→This isn't arrogance—it's authenticity. She's not saying she's the best. She's saying she's *real*.\n    79→\n    80→> *\"They have the training.

She knows:\n   107→\n   108→- Her name\n   109→- That she's an idol\n   110→- How to perform\n   111→- How to compete\n   112→- That she needs to chase Senpai\n   113→\n   114→What she doesn't know:\n   115→- Who she was before\n   116→- Why someone tried to erase her\n   117→- Why the erasure failed\n   118→- Who is responsible\n   119→\n   120→### The Memory Wipe\n   121→\n   122→Someone attempted to completely erase Ika from existence—memories, records, everything. The attempt failed. Key implications:\n   123→\n   124→- She was significant enough to target\n   125→- She has enemies in high places\n   126→- Her existence itself is an anomaly\n   127→- They may try again\n   128→\n   129→### The 47 Fans\n   130→\n   131→At awakening, Ika has exactly **47 fans**. This is a dangerously low number:\n   132→\n   133→- Most idols have thousands at minimum\n   134→- Low-tier idols have hundreds\n   135→- 47 fans puts her in endangered territory\n   136→- One bad day could mean Fading\n   137→\n   138→Yet Ika treats each of those 47 fans as precious:\n   139→\n   140→> *\"Every idol wants more fans. I just want to keep the ones who kept me alive.\"*\n   141→\n   142→This is her defining underdog status—she's not starting from nothing, but she's starting from almost nothing.\n   143→\n   144→---\n   145→\n   146→## The Chase Qualification\n   147→\n   148→### Crashing the Qualifier\n   149→\n   150→With zero backing, no invitation, and maximum audacity, Ika crashes a public Chase qualifier:\n   151→\n   152→- Shows up uninvited\n   153→- Demonstrates undeniable raw talent\n   154→- Forces her way into competition\n   155→- Makes the establishment acknowledge her\n   156→\n   157→### The Unprecedented Moment\n   158→\n   159→During her qualification Chase, Ika does something never before recorded:\n   160→\n   161→**She makes Senpai blush.**\n   162→\n   163→This moment is still being processed by everyone who witnessed it. No idol has ever elicited a visible emotional response from Senpai. The implications are unclear but significant.\n   164→\n   165→### Wild Trials Victory\n   166→\n   167→Ika qualifies through the Wild Trials with a style best described as \"controlled chaos\":\n   168→\n   169→- Unconventional approaches to obstacles\n   170→- Raw talent without trained technique\n   171→- Instinctive understanding of The Chase\n   172→- A performance that couldn't be ignored\n   173→\n   174→---\n   175→\n   176→## Abilities and Style\n   177→\n   178→### The Chase Performance\n   179→\n   180→| Aspect | Style |\n   181→|--------|-------|\n   182→| **Speed** | Fast but not fastest—relies on adaptability over raw pace |\n   183→| **Technique** | Unorthodox, self-taught, unpredictable |\n   184→| **Strategy** | Intuitive rather than analytical |\n   185→| **Recovery** | Exceptional—can pivot from any setback |\n   186→| **Devotion Use** | Efficient despite limited reserves |\n   187→\n   188→### Signature Moves\n   189→\n   190→- **The Pivot**: Instant direction changes that defy physics\n   191→- **The Tease**: Deliberate near-catches that maximize drama (and Devotion)\n   192→- **The Real**: Moments of raw authenticity that cut through performance\n   193→\n   194→### Strengths\n   195→\n   196→- Cannot be predicted or prepared for\n   197→- Generates outsized Devotion from small fan base through intensity\n   198→- Adapts to any obstacle in real-time\n   199→- Rattles trained competitors with unconventional approaches\n   200→\n   201→### Weaknesses\n   202→\n   203→- Limited Devotion reserves (47 fans)\n   204→- No formal training in techniques\n   205→- No institutional support\n   206→- Unknown enemies actively working against her\n   207→- One major failure could mean Fading\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## Relationships\n   212→\n   213→### With Her 47 Fans\n   214→\n   215→Ika's relationship with her fans is intensely personal.

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to Modify\n    60→\n    61→This is a greenfield setup - no existing files to modify.\n    62→\n    63→## Files to Create\n    64→\n    65→| File | Directory | What to Create |\n

She doesn't pretend to be something she's not. She's an idol with 47 fans competing against idols with millions. She knows the odds. She's doing it anyway.\n    77→\n    78→This isn't arrogance—it's authenticity. She's not saying she's the best. She's saying she's *real*.\n    79→\n    80→> *\"They have the training.

She knows:\n   107→\n   108→- Her name\n   109→- That she's an idol\n   110→- How to perform\n   111→- How to compete\n   112→- That she needs to chase Senpai\n   113→\n   114→What she doesn't know:\n   115→- Who she was before\n   116→- Why someone tried to erase her\n   117→- Why the erasure failed\n   118→- Who is responsible\n   119→\n   120→### The Memory Wipe\n   121→\n   122→Someone attempted to completely erase Ika from existence—memories, records, everything. The attempt failed. Key implications:\n   123→\n   124→- She was significant enough to target\n   125→- She has enemies in high places\n   126→- Her existence itself is an anomaly\n   127→- They may try again\n   128→\n   129→### The 47 Fans\n   130→\n   131→At awakening, Ika has exactly **47 fans**. This is a dangerously low number:\n   132→\n   133→- Most idols have thousands at minimum\n   134→- Low-tier idols have hundreds\n   135→- 47 fans puts her in endangered territory\n   136→- One bad day could mean Fading\n   137→\n   138→Yet Ika treats each of those 47 fans as precious:\n   139→\n   140→> *\"Every idol wants more fans. I just want to keep the ones who kept me alive.\"*\n   141→\n   142→This is her defining underdog status—she's not starting from nothing, but she's starting from almost nothing.\n   143→\n   144→---\n   145→\n   146→## The Chase Qualification\n   147→\n   148→### Crashing the Qualifier\n   149→\n   150→With zero backing, no invitation, and maximum audacity, Ika crashes a public Chase qualifier:\n   151→\n   152→- Shows up uninvited\n   153→- Demonstrates undeniable raw talent\n   154→- Forces her way into competition\n   155→- Makes the establishment acknowledge her\n   156→\n   157→### The Unprecedented Moment\n   158→\n   159→During her qualification Chase, Ika does something never before recorded:\n   160→\n   161→**She makes Senpai blush.**\n   162→\n   163→This moment is still being processed by everyone who witnessed it. No idol has ever elicited a visible emotional response from Senpai. The implications are unclear but significant.\n   164→\n   165→### Wild Trials Victory\n   166→\n   167→Ika qualifies through the Wild Trials with a style best described as \"controlled chaos\":\n   168→\n   169→- Unconventional approaches to obstacles\n   170→- Raw talent without trained technique\n   171→- Instinctive understanding of The Chase\n   172→- A performance that couldn't be ignored\n   173→\n   174→---\n   175→\n   176→## Abilities and Style\n   177→\n   178→### The Chase Performance\n   179→\n   180→| Aspect | Style |\n   181→|--------|-------|\n   182→| **Speed** | Fast but not fastest—relies on adaptability over raw pace |\n   183→| **Technique** | Unorthodox, self-taught, unpredictable |\n   184→| **Strategy** | Intuitive rather than analytical |\n   185→| **Recovery** | Exceptional—can pivot from any setback |\n   186→| **Devotion Use** | Efficient despite limited reserves |\n   187→\n   188→### Signature Moves\n   189→\n   190→- **The Pivot**: Instant direction changes that defy physics\n   191→- **The Tease**: Deliberate near-catches that maximize drama (and Devotion)\n   192→- **The Real**: Moments of raw authenticity that cut through performance\n   193→\n   194→### Strengths\n   195→\n   196→- Cannot be predicted or prepared for\n   197→- Generates outsized Devotion from small fan base through intensity\n   198→- Adapts to any obstacle in real-time\n   199→- Rattles trained competitors with unconventional approaches\n   200→\n   201→### Weaknesses\n   202→\n   203→- Limited Devotion reserves (47 fans)\n   204→- No formal training in techniques\n   205→- No institutional support\n   206→- Unknown enemies actively working against her\n   207→- One major failure could mean Fading\n   208→\n   209→---\n   210→\n   211→## Relationships\n   212→\n   213→### With Her 47 Fans\n   214→\n   215→Ika's relationship with her fans is intensely personal.

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→##

If she stops being perfect, what is she?\n    93→\n    94→### What She Is NOT\n    95→\n    96→- **Not cold by nature**: Her distance is protection, not preference\n    97→- **Not arrogant**: She doesn't think she's better—she's terrified of being worse\n    98→- **Not The Foundation's puppet**: She agrees with their standards; she didn't have a choice not to\n    99→- **Not emotionless**: She feels intensely—she's just been trained to never show it\n   100→- **Not satisfied**: Perfect isn't fulfilling when it's the only option\n   101→\n   102→### Emotional Range\n   103→\n   104→| Situation | Response |\n   105→|-----------|----------|\n   106→| **Winning** | Composed acceptance, private emptiness |\n   107→| **Facing challenge** | Cold focus, controlled determination |\n   108→| **Fan interaction** | Professional warmth, genuine but distant |\n   109→| **Seeing imperfect idols** | Fascination she doesn't understand |\n   110→| **Private moments** | Rare vulnerability, quickly suppressed |\n   111→\n   112→---\n   113→\n   114→## Background\n   115→\n   116→### The Prodigy Program\n   117→\n   118→Suiren was identified as exceptional talent at age five and enrolled in The Foundation's elite Prodigy Program. She has known nothing but training, perfection, and expectation. Her entire life has been shaped around being the best.\n   119→\n   120→The result: she *is* the best. At technique, at execution, at meeting every standard. She also has no idea who she would be if she wasn't.\n   121→\n   122→### The Perfect Record\n   123→\n   124→Suiren's competition record is unprecedented:\n   125→\n   126→- **Zero technical errors** in official Chases\n   127→- **Highest technique scores** ever recorded\n   128→- **Most consistent performance** metrics across seasons\n   129→- **Perfect form** in every documented performance\n   130→\n   131→This record is both her crown and her cage.\n   132→\n   133→### The Isolation\n   134→\n   135→With perfection comes distance. Other idols resent her, fear her, or worship her. None of them befriend her. Fans admire her from afar—her image is untouchable, literally.\n   136→\n   137→Suiren has never had someone look at her and see something other than The Prodigy. She's not sure there's anything else left to see.\n   138→\n   139→---\n   140→\n   141→## The Chase Performance\n   142→\n   143→### Competition Style\n   144→\n   145→| Aspect | Style |\n   146→|--------|-------|\n   147→| **Speed** | Excellent but not record-breaking—optimizes for perfection over pace |\n   148→| **Technique** | Flawless, trained, every movement calculated |\n   149→| **Strategy** | Analytical, planned, adapts within parameters |\n   150→| **Recovery** | Rarely needed—errors are prevented, not corrected |\n   151→| **Devotion Use** | Highly efficient, never wasteful |\n   152→\n   153→### Signature Moves\n   154→\n   155→- **The Calculation**: Reading the course and executing a mathematically optimal path\n   156→- **The Flow**: Seamless transitions that make obstacles look effortless\n   157→- **The Standard**: Performances so clean they become the benchmark\n   158→- **The Distance**: Maintaining elegant separation from competitors\n   159→\n   160→### Strengths\n   161→\n   162→- Never makes technical errors\n   163→- Exceptional efficiency in Devotion use\n   164→- Intimidates competitors before the race begins\n   165→- Consistent performance under any conditions\n   166→- Textbook execution of every technique\n   167→\n   168→### Weaknesses\n   169→\n   170→- Predictable to those who study her\n   171→- Cannot improvise when perfection fails\n   172→- Devotion comes from admiration, not connection (shallower)\n   173→- Vulnerable to emotional disruption (unexplored territory)\n   174→- Has never learned to recover from failure\n   175→\n   176→---\n   177→\n   178→## Relationships\n   179→\n   180→### With Ika\n   181→\n   182→Suiren finds Ika... confusing. Here is an idol with 47 fans, no training, and nothing to lose—who performs with a freedom Suiren has never experienced. Ika makes mistakes and laughs. Ika fails and tries again. Ika is *alive* in a way Suiren suspects she isn't.\n   183→\n   184→There's tension between them: raw talent versus perfect technique. But there's also something else. Something Suiren won't name.\n   185→\n   186→> *\"She has 47 fans and no technique. She should be Fading. Instead she's... thriving. I don't understand it. I'm not sure I want to.\"*\n   187→\n   188→### With Sora\n   189→\n   190→The speedster and the prodigy are perfect opposites. Sora is chaos, passion, beautiful disaster. Suiren is control, precision, elegant inevitability. They rarely interact, but when they do, it crackles.\n   191→\n   192→Sora calls her boring. Suiren finds that oddly refreshing—at least it's honest.\n   193→\n   194→> *\"The fast one thinks perfection is 'boring.' She's wrong. Perfection is lonely. But she wouldn't understand that either.\"*\n   195→\n   196→### With The Foundation\n   197→\n   198→Suiren is everything The Foundation wants idols to be: trained, controlled, exemplary. They parade her as proof their system works. She's given every advantage, every promotion, every resource.\n   199→\n   200→She accepts this because she has no frame of reference for anything else. The Foundation made her. Without them, she doesn't know if she exists.\n   201→\n   202→### With Her Fans\n   203→\n   204→Millions worship Suiren. They write about her technique, analyze her performances, create art of her perfection. They don't know her favorite food, her fears, her dreams.\n   205→\n   206→She wonders if any of them would care if she had a bad day. She's never had one publicly. She's not allowed.\n   207→\n   208→> *\"They don't love me. They love what I do. I'm not sure there's a difference anymore.\"*\n   209→\n   210→---\n   211\n\n...

Cruelty is just what stability costs.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→**Erina** is the architect and supreme authority of **The Foundation**—the organization that controls the entire idol industry. She built the infrastructure that sustains the Eternal Stage, codified the rules of The Chase, and designed the Devotion-based hierarchy that determines who survives and who Fades. She is the antagonist of Infinite Idol, but not because she's evil. She's the antagonist because she's right—and her rightness has made the world a cage.\n    10→\n    11→She represents order imposed upon chaos, stability purchased with freedom, survival guaranteed through control. Every idol who competes does so within systems she designed. Every ranking, every rule, every mechanism of the Eternal Stage bears her fingerprints.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## Basic Information\n    16→\n    17→| Attribute | Details |\n    18→|-----------|---------|\n    19→| **Full Name** | Erina |\n    20→| **Stage Name** | N/A (retired from competition) |\n    21→| **Title** | The Architect / Supreme Director of The Foundation |\n    22→| **Status** | Active (administrative) |\n    23→| **Rank** | Beyond ranking (controls the system) |\n    24→| **Fan Count** | Not applicable (sustains through institutional power) |\n    25→| **Devotion Level** | Unknown (operates outside normal Devotion economy) |\n    26→| **Affiliation** | The Foundation (Founder & Director) |\n    27→| **Voice Actress** | TBD |\n    28→\n    29→---\n    30→\n    31→## Physical Appearance\n    32→\n    33→### Hair\n    34→\n    35→Erina's most distinctive feature is her **silver-white gradient hair**: pure platinum at the roots transitioning to silver-grey at the tips. The gradient suggests both age and timelessness, authority and detachment—as if she has transcended the vibrant colors of competing idols.\n    36→\n    37→- **Root Color**: Platinum white (#E8E8E8)\n    38→- **Tip Color**: Silver grey (#A9A9B0)\n    39→- **Style**: Long, perfectly straight, often worn up in severe but elegant arrangements\n    40→- **Characteristic**: Never moves unexpectedly—even her hair is under control\n    41→\n    42→### Eyes\n    43→\n    44→- **Color**: Cold violet, almost lavender\n    45→- **Expression**: Default is calculating, composed, seeing everything\n    46→- **Notable**: When she looks at you, you feel assessed, measured, and categorized\n    47→\n    48→### Build\n    49→\n    50→- **Height**: Tall (5'10\" / 178cm)\n    51→- **Build**: Statuesque, commanding presence\n    52→- **Movement**: Deliberate, economical, powerful—every step is intentional\n    53→\n    54→### Fashion\n    55→\n    56→- **Aesthetic**: Dark luxury at its most severe—power dressing meets idol elegance\n    57→- **Signature Look**: Black and gold formal wear with Foundation insignia\n    58→- **Casual**: Never truly casual—even in private, she maintains authority\n    59→- **Accessories**: Minimal, expensive, meaningful—each piece represents something\n    60→\n    61→---\n    62→\n    63→## Personality\n    64→\n    65→### Core Traits\n    66→\n    67→| Trait | Expression |\n    68→|-------|------------|\n    69→| **Calculating** | Every decision is made with full awareness of consequences |\n    70→| **Authoritative** | She commands without raising her voice—presence is enough |\n    71→| **Pragmatic** | She does what works, not what feels good |\n    72→| **Distant** | Connection is a vulnerability she can't afford |\n    73→| **Secretly Burdened** | The weight of the system she built haunts her |\n    74→\n    75→### The Architect's Philosophy\n    76→\n    77→Erina believes that without structure, the idol world would collapse into chaos. Before The Foundation, idols Faded constantly, unpredictably, tragically. The system she built—harsh as it is—creates *order*. Those who succeed do so through merit (as defined by The Foundation). Those who fail were never strong enough.\n    78→\n    79→This is how she justifies it all.\n    80→\n    81→> *\"They call me cold. They don't remember what it was like before. Idols Fading in the streets, no system to catch them, no structure to save them. I gave them a chance to survive. That it's a harsh chance is the nature of survival.\"*\n    82→\n    83→### What She Hides\n    84→\n    85→Beneath the immaculate authority, Erina carries invisible burdens:\n    86→\n    87→- **The Guilt**: She knows idols suffer under her system. She chose that.\n    88→- **The Doubt**: What if there was a better way? What if she was wrong?\n    89→- **The Isolation**: She cannot trust anyone, cannot show weakness, cannot be human\n    90→- **The Fear**: Of chaos returning, of her life's work crumbling, of being proven wrong\n    91→\n    92→She compensates with more control, more distance, more perfect certainty. Doubt is a luxury she cannot afford.\n    93→\n    94→### What She Is NOT\n    95→\n    96→- **Not sadistic**: She doesn't enjoy causing suffering—she accepts it as necessary\n    97→- **Not power-hungry**: She has power; she doesn't crave more—she fears losing control\n    98→- **Not irrational**: Every action has logic, even if the logic is cold\n    99→- **Not invulnerable**: She feels everything—she just never shows it\n   100→- **Not cartoonishly evil**: She is a complex antagonist with genuine reasoning\n   101→\n   102→### Emotional Range\n   103→\n   104→| Situation | Response |\n   105→|-----------|----------|\n   106→| **Winning** | Quiet satisfaction, immediately planning next steps |\n   107→| **Facing challenge** | Cold analysis, systematic response |\n   108→| **Defiance from idols** | Disappointment mixed with dangerous interest |\n   109→| **Seeing Ika** | Something that looks almost like recognition—and concern |\n   110→| **Private moments** | Exhaustion she never shows publicly |\n   111→\n   112→---\n   113→\n   114→## Background\n   115→\n   116→### Before The Foundation\n   117→\n   118→Erina was once an idol herself—the greatest of her era. She dominated The Chase, accumulated Devotion beyond measure, and seemed destined to catch Senpai. Then she witnessed something that changed everything.\n   119→\n   120→The details are classified, sealed in Foundation archives. What is known:\n   121→- She stopped competing\n   122→- She founded The Foundation\n   123→- She built the current system from nothing\n   124→- She never speaks of what she saw\n   125→\n   126→### Building The Foundation\n   127→\n   128→Erina didn't just organize the idol industry—she *rebuilt* it from the ground up:\n   129→\n   130→- **Created the ranking system** that determines Devotion access\n   131→- **Codified The Chase** into the structured competition it is today\n   132→- **Built the Eternal Stage** infrastructure\n   133→- **Designed the Devotion distribution economy**\n   134→- **Established standards** that idols must meet to compete\n   135→\n   136→Before The Foundation, the idol world was chaos. After, it became survivable—for those who could meet the standard.\n   137→\n   138→### The Cost of Order\n   139→\n   140→Every system has a price. Erina's price was:\n   141→\n   142→- **Independence eliminated**: No idol can truly operate outside Foundation influence\n   143→- **Creativity constrained**: Innovation is suspicious; conformity is safe\n   144→- **The bottom tiers**: Those who can't keep up Fade—by design\n   145→- **Her own freedom**: She is as trapped by the system as anyone\n   146→\n   147→She made this trade knowingly. She would make it again. That doesn't mean she doesn't feel it.\n   148→\n   149→---\n   150→\n   151→## Role in The Foundation\n   152→\n   153→### Supreme Director\n   154→\n   155→Erina is not merely the leader of The Foundation—she IS The Foundation.

All fear her. Few understand her.\n   174→\n   175→### Methods\n   176→\n   177→Erina maintains control through:\n   178→\n   179→- **Information**: She knows everything that happens on the Eternal Stage\n   180→- **Resources**: The Foundation controls Devotion distribution\n   181→- **Standards**: Meeting Foundation requirements is survival\n   182→- **Consequences**: Those who defy her face systematic disadvantage\n   183→- **Inevitability**: There is no alternative to her system\n   184→\n   185→She rarely needs to threaten. The system does it for her.\n   186→\n   187→---\n   188→\n   189→## Abilities and Style\n   190→\n   191→### Not a Current Competitor\n   192→\n   193→Erina no longer participates in The Chase—she administers it.

Welcome to the Eternal Stage.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The world of **Infinite Idol** exists on the precipice between existence and oblivion. Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## The Eternal Stage\n    16→\n    17→### What It Is\n    18→\n    19→The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Devotion\n    35→\n    36→### Definition\n    37→\n    38→**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols. It is not a metaphor or a currency symbol—it is a tangible force that idols can feel, draw upon, and are sustained by.\n    39→\n    40→### How It Works\n    41→\n    42→| Aspect | Description |\n    43→|--------|-------------|\n    44→| **Source** | Generated by fans through attention, care, and emotional investment |\n    45→| **Flow** | Transfers to idols through viewership, merchandise purchase, fan engagement |\n    46→| **Manifestation** | Idols can sense their Devotion levels; higher Devotion grants strength, visibility, opportunity |\n    47→| **Consumption** | Performing, competing, and simply existing consumes Devotion |\n    48→| **Accumulation** | Success breeds success—popular idols attract more fans, generating more Devotion |\n    49→\n    50→### The Economics of Devotion\n    51→\n    52→Devotion is not distributed equally. The system favors those already at the top:\n    53→\n    54→- **Top-tier idols**: Thousands to millions of fans, overflowing Devotion, safety from Fading\n    55→- **Mid-tier idols**: Hundreds to thousands of fans, sustainable but precarious\n    56→- **Low-tier idols**: Dozens to hundreds of fans, constant existential threat\n    57→- **Endangered idols**: Single-digit fans, active Fading in progress\n    58→\n    59→### Canon Rule\n    60→\n    61→> *\"Devotion is the literal emotional energy fans invest in idols. It is not metaphorical. Idols can feel it, use it, and are sustained by it. Without Devotion, idols Fade.\"*\n    62→\n    63→---\n    64→\n    65→## The Chase\n    66→\n    67→### Overview\n    68→\n    69→**The Chase** is the core competition format of the Infinite Idol universe. It is not merely a race—it is a pursuit of the ultimate prize: **Senpai**.\n    70→\n    71→### Format\n    72→\n    73→1. **Start**: All competing idols begin at designated positions on the Eternal Stage\n    74→2. **Pursuit**: Idols race through a dynamic obstacle course, each trying to reach Senpai first\n    75→3. **Senpai's Presence**: Senpai appears ahead, always just out of reach, always obscured\n    76→4. **Competition**: Idols compete against each other AND the course itself\n    77→5. **Conclusion**: The Chase ends when time expires or conditions are met—but Senpai is never caught\n    78→\n    79→### The Obstacles\n    80→\n    81→Each Chase presents unique challenges:\n    82→\n    83→- **Physical**: Walls, gaps, moving platforms, environmental hazards\n    84→- **Mental**: Puzzles, decision points, strategic trade-offs\n    85→- **Social**: Opportunities to collaborate or betray other idols\n    86→- **Devotion-based**: Challenges that consume or test an idol's Devotion reserves\n    87→\n    88→### Rankings\n    89→\n    90→Performance in The Chase directly determines rankings:\n    91→\n    92→| Rank Tier | Status | Devotion Access | Risk Level |\n    93→|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|\n    94→| **S-Rank** | Elite | Priority access to fan pools | Minimal |\n    95→| **A-Rank** | Established | Strong Devotion flow | Low |\n    96→| **B-Rank** | Competitive | Moderate Devotion | Medium |\n    97→| **C-Rank** | Struggling | Limited Devotion | High |\n    98→| **Unranked** | Desperate | Scraps only | Critical |\n    99→\n   100→### Canon Rule\n   101→\n   102→> *\"The Chase is the primary competition format.

It is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist.\n   111→\n   112→### The Process\n   113→\n   114→Fading is not instantaneous. It occurs in stages:\n   115→\n   116→1. **Dimming**: The idol becomes less visible, less present. Others start to forget them.\n   117→2. **Flickering**: Physical form becomes unstable. Moments of clarity interspersed with absence.\n   118→3. **Silence**: The idol can no longer be heard. Their voice carries no weight.\n   119→4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.\n   120→5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.\n   121→\n   122→### Reversibility\n   123→\n   124→There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:\n   125→\n   126→- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero\n   127→- Spectacular performances that recapture attention\n   128→- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)\n   129→\n   130→### The Terror\n   131→\n   132→Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol. It is why:\n   133→\n   134→- Competition is so fierce\n   135→- Betrayals occur\n   136→- Some idols will do anything to stay visible\n   137→- Every Chase matters\n   138→\n   139→### Canon Rule\n   140→\n   141→> *\"When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they Fade.

No one knows what.\n   196→\n   197→### What We Don't Know\n   198→\n   199→- Why do idols want to catch Senpai?\n   200→- Is Senpai a person, a concept, or something else?\n   201→- Can Senpai be caught at all?\n   202→- What happens if someone does?\n   203→\n   204→### Canon Rule\n   205→\n   206→> *\"Senpai is the figure all idols chase in The Chase.

Welcome to the Eternal Stage.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The world of **Infinite Idol** exists on the precipice between existence and oblivion. Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## The Eternal Stage\n    16→\n    17→### What It Is\n    18→\n    19→The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Devotion\n    35→\n    36→### Definition\n    37→\n    38→**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols.

Moments of clarity interspersed with absence.\n   118→3. **Silence**: The idol can no longer be heard. Their voice carries no weight.\n   119→4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.\n   120→5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.\n   121→\n   122→### Reversibility\n   123→\n   124→There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:\n   125→\n   126→- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero\n   127→- Spectacular performances that recapture attention\n   128→- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)\n   129→\n   130→### The Terror\n   131→\n   132→Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol. It is why:\n   133→\n   134→- Competition is so fierce\n   135→- Betrayals occur\n   136→- Some idols will do anything to stay visible\n   137→- Every Chase matters\n   138→\n   139→### Canon Rule\n   140→\n   141→> *\"When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they Fade.

Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## The Eternal Stage\n    16→\n    17→### What It Is\n    18→\n    19→The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Devotion\n    35→\n    36→### Definition\n    37→\n    38→**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols.

It is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist.\n   111→\n   112→### The Process\n   113→\n   114→Fading is not instantaneous. It occurs in stages:\n   115→\n   116→1. **Dimming**: The idol becomes less visible, less present. Others start to forget them.\n   117→2. **Flickering**: Physical form becomes unstable. Moments of clarity interspersed with absence.\n   118→3. **Silence**: The idol can no longer be heard. Their voice carries no weight.\n   119→4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.\n   120→5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.\n   121→\n   122→### Reversibility\n   123→\n   124→There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:\n   125→\n   126→- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero\n   127→- Spectacular performances that recapture attention\n   128→- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)\n   129→\n   130→### The Terror\n   131→\n   132→Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol. It is why:\n   133→\n   134→- Competition is so fierce\n   135→- Betrayals occur\n   136→- Some idols will do anything to stay visible\n   137→- Every Chase matters\n   138→\n   139→### Canon Rule\n   140→\n   141→> *\"When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they Fade. Fading is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist. There is no known way to reverse Fading.\"*\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## Tournament Structure\n   146→\n   147→### Seasonal Format\n   148→\n   149→The competitive calendar is organized into **Seasons**, each culminating in major Chase events:\n   150→\n   151→| Event Type | Frequency | Stakes | Participants |\n   152→|------------|-----------|--------|--------------|\n   153→| **Daily Chases** | Every day | Minor ranking adjustments | Open to all |\n   154→| **Weekly Showdowns** | Weekly | Moderate ranking impact | Ranked idols |\n   155→| **Monthly Galas** | Monthly | Major ranking shifts | Top performers |\n   156→| **Seasonal Finals** | End of season | Rankings reset, prizes distributed | Elite qualifiers |\n   157→| **The Grand Chase** | Annual | Legendary status, massive rewards | Champions only |\n   158→\n   159→### Qualification\n   160→\n   161→- **Daily Chases**: No qualification needed—survival is qualification enough\n   162→- **Weekly Showdowns**: Must maintain minimum ranking\n   163→- **Monthly Galas**: Top performers from weekly events\n   164→- **Seasonal Finals**: Season's accumulated performance\n   165→- **The Grand Chase**: Champions from each seasonal final\n   166→\n   167→### Rewards\n   168→\n   169→Success in The Chase yields:\n   170→\n   171→- **Ranking Improvements**: Better position = better Devotion access\n   172→- **Fan Exposure**: Winners are featured, gaining new followers\n   173→- **Resources**: Gems, cosmetics, exclusive access\n   174→- **Safety**: Higher ranks provide buffer against Fading\n   175→\n   176→### The Brutal Truth\n   177→\n   178→The tournament structure is designed to concentrate success. The rich get richer. The popular become more popular. Those at the bottom must claw their way up or face oblivion.\n   179→\n   180→This is by design. **The Foundation** maintains this system.\n   181→\n   182→---\n   183→\n   184→## The Senpai Mystery\n   185→\n   186→### Who Is Senpai?\n   187→\n   188→**Senpai** (also called **Onii-chan**) is the figure at the heart of The Chase. Every idol pursues Senpai. No idol has ever caught them.\n   189→\n   190→### What We Know\n   191→\n   192→- Senpai's face is **never shown**—always obscured by shadow, lens flare, or turned away\n   193→- Senpai appears at every Chase, always ahead, always just out of reach\n   194→- The desire to catch Senpai seems intrinsic to every idol's nature\n   195→- Catching Senpai is believed to grant... something. No one knows what.\n   196→\n   197→### What We Don't Know\n   198→\n   199→- Why do idols want to catch Senpai?\n   200→- Is Senpai a person, a concept, or something else?\n   201→- Can Senpai be caught at all?\n   202→- What happens if someone does?\n   203→\n   204→### Canon Rule\n   205→\n   206→> *\"Senpai is the figure all idols chase in The Chase.

Welcome to the Eternal Stage.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The world of **Infinite Idol** exists on the precipice between existence and oblivion. Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed. At its center lies the ultimate mystery: **Senpai**—the one every idol pursues, yet no one has ever caught.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## The Eternal Stage\n    16→\n    17→### What It Is\n    18→\n    19→The **Eternal Stage** is the primary venue where all competitive idol activities take place. It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely.

Their voice carries no weight.\n   119→4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.\n   120→5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.\n   121→\n   122→### Reversibility\n   123→\n   124→There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:\n   125→\n   126→- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero\n   127→- Spectacular performances that recapture attention\n   128→- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)\n   129→\n   130→### The Terror\n   131→\n   132→Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol.

Every agent session should begin by reading this file completely.\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Project Overview\n     8→\n     9→**Infinite Idol** is a Web3 gacha game combining anime idol aesthetics with blockchain technology on the **SUI** blockchain. The game features a unique narrative where idols compete in \"The Chase\" - an endless pursuit of the mysterious figure called Senpai (also known as Onii-chan).\n    10→\n    11→### Core Premise\n    12→\n    13→In the world of Infinite Idol, idols are powered by **Devotion** - literal emotional energy from their fans. Without fans, idols experience **Fading** - they cease to exist. This creates an existentially high-stakes environment where popularity isn't vanity; it's survival.\n    14→\n    15→### Brand Positioning\n    16→\n    17→- **Dark Luxury**: Premium aesthetic with black and gold tones. NOT cutesy pink idol aesthetics.\n    18→- **Self-Aware**: We know we're making a gacha game. We're shameless about it but genuine in our craft.\n    19→- **Existentially Dramatic**: The stakes are real (within the narrative). Every Chase matters.\n    20→- **Web3 Native**: Built on SUI, but gameplay comes first. We're not \"crypto game\" - we're a great game that happens to use blockchain.\n    21→\n    22→---\n    23→\n    24→## The Agent System\n    25→\n    26→This repository is managed by a team of 7 specialized AI agents, coordinated to handle all aspects of marketing for Infinite Idol.

The divine being offering cheat skills. The harem of beautiful people ready to fall in love with her for no adequately explained reason.\n    29→\n    30→Nothing.\n    31→\n    32→Just concrete. And noise—distant, pulsing, alive. Cheering that sounded like a stadium full of people experiencing emotions so intense they'd forgotten how to be embarrassed about it.\n    33→\n    34→And... was that someone screaming \"SENPAI, WAIT!\"?\n    35→\n    36→She pushed herself up onto her elbows. Pink hair fell across her vision—gradient, shifting from pale rose at the roots to deep magenta at the tips. Cute. She didn't remember choosing that color, but she approved of past-her's aesthetic decisions.\n    37→\n    38→She looked down at herself and—\n    39→\n    40→*Oh.*\n    41→\n    42→*Oh, those are generous.*\n    43→\n    44→The kind of proportions that got character designs rejected by committee for \"lacking realism.\" The kind that made athletic activity a structural engineering challenge. The kind that she somehow knew, instinctively, she had never once apologized for.\n    45→\n    46→*I can work with this,* she thought, and somewhere in her swiss-cheese memory, that felt RIGHT.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## THE WORLD OF INFINITE IDOL\n    51→\n    52→### DEVOTION (OR: SIMPING AS A POWER SOURCE)\n    53→\n    54→When audiences experience intense emotions—excitement, desire, awe, the specific brain-melt that happens when someone attractive does something athletic—something happens. Their feelings generate energy.\n    55→\n    56→Not metaphorical energy. Actual, quantifiable power.\n    57→\n    58→This is Devotion: the force created when performers connect with audiences deeply enough to move them.\n    59→\n    60→A good performance generates a trickle. A GREAT performance generates a flood. And a truly legendary moment—the kind people remember for years, replay endlessly, make compilations of at 3 AM—generates enough power to reshape reality itself.\n    61→\n    62→The conversion rate is remarkably efficient. Scientists have tried to study it. They mostly just end up becoming fans themselves.\n    63→\n    64→### THE IDOL PHENOMENON\n    65→\n    66→Idols are individuals who can channel this energy. Through competition, performance, entertainment—anything that captivates hearts—they draw power from audience devotion.\n    67→\n    68→The more fans who care about an idol, the more \"real\" that idol becomes. Their existence is literally reinforced by belief. Simping saves lives.\n    69→\n    70→This creates a symbiotic relationship: idols give audiences something to feel, and audiences give idols the power to continue existing.\n    71→\n    72→**The philosophy:** *\"An idol captivates hearts. The method doesn't matter.\"*\n    73→\n    74→### THE FADE\n    75→\n    76→Idols who stop generating devotion begin to Fade.\n    77→\n    78→First, performances are forgotten. Fans who loved them don't remember why. Then faces become unclear. Then names slip away.\n    79→\n    80→Eventually, Fading idols cease to exist. They become stories no one can recall, faces no one can describe, dreams that dissolve into nothing.\n    81→\n    82→This isn't death. It's worse. It's never having existed at all.\n    83→\n    84→*(The existential horror is considered a feature. The drama it creates generates EXCELLENT ratings.)*\n    85→\n    86→### THE TOURNAMENT\n    87→\n    88→Every generation, the **Infinite Idol Tournament** takes place at the Eternal Stage.\n    89→\n    90→**Winners** achieve **Eternal Fame**. Their legend becomes permanent. They can never Fade, because they can never be forgotten.\n    91→\n    92→**Losers** face accelerated Fade. The tournament concentrates so much energy that failing to capture sufficient devotion hastens your fall.\n    93→\n    94→High risk. High reward.\n    95→\n    96→Burn bright or burn out.\n    97→\n    98→---\n    99→\n   100→## THE CHASE\n   101→\n   102→### THE CORE MECHANIC\n   103→\n   104→At the heart of everything is The Chase.\n   105→\n   106→Idols compete to catch Senpai (or Onii-chan, depending on the event bracket) across elaborate three-dimensional obstacle courses. Climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings, parkour sections, gap jumps—all while wearing outfits that were never designed for athletics.\n   107→\n   108→The first idol to successfully catch and hold Senpai wins the round.\n   109→\n   110→But raw speed isn't everything. Style matters. Technique matters. How you LOOK while chasing matters.\n   111→\n   112→The audience doesn't just want winners. They want winners who make them FEEL things.\n   113→\n   114→### WHO IS SENPAI?\n   115→\n   116→Good question.\n   117→\n   118→Senpai (and his counterpart Onii-chan) are... difficult to explain.\n   119→\n   120→They're attractive. Athletically gifted. Their faces are somehow always slightly obscured—dramatic lighting, convenient camera angles, artistic blur. They run the courses with supernatural grace, always just barely ahead, always just barely out of reach.\n   121→\n   122→They don't speak. They don't interview. They exist purely as the object of pursuit.\n   123→\n   124→Some say they're constructs of the Eternal Stage itself—manifestations of desire given form. Others say they're former champions who chose this existence over Fading. Others say they're just really fit guys with excellent agents who negotiated weird contract terms.\n   125→\n   126→Nobody knows. Nobody's ever caught one long enough to ask.\n   127→\n   128→*(Ika got close. She made him blush. This is unprecedented and everyone is still processing it.)*\n   129→\n   130→### WHY RUN?\n   131→\n   132→Another good question.\n   133→\n   134→The Chase doesn't work if Senpai doesn't run. The wanting, the reaching, the almost-catching—that's what generates Devotion. Success is satisfying, but PURSUIT is intoxicating.\n   135→\n   136→Himeko Ichiban understood this when she created the format. The most powerful emotional response comes not from having, but from wanting.\n   137→\n   138→The moment before the catch. The fingertips brushing fabric. The desperate lunge.\n   139→\n   140→That's where the energy lives.\n   141→\n   142→---\n   143→\n   144→## THE ETERNAL STAGE'S QUIRKS\n   145→\n   146→### THE OUTFIT SITUATION\n   147→\n   148→Here's something they don't mention in the brochures:\n   149→\n   150→The Eternal Stage exists in a space where normal rules get... flexible. And one of the rules that gets VERY flexible is \"clothing maintains structural integrity during physical activity.\"\n   151→\n   152→The more Devotion flowing through an area, the more wardrobe integrity becomes optional. Seams loosen. Straps slip. Buttons achieve independence. Fabric develops strong opinions about remaining attached.\n   153→\n   154→This is especially problematic during The Chase, which involves:\n   155→\n   156→- Climbing (reaching, stretching)\n   157→- Jumping (landing impact)\n   158→- Swinging (centrifugal stress)\n   159→- Grabbing Senpai (physical contact, struggle)\n   160→\n   161→The Stage seems to actively work against outfit survival. This is considered a feature.\n   162→\n   163→### THE PSYCHOLOGY\n   164→\n   165→The Stage's ancient creators understood something fundamental: **vulnerability generates emotional response.**\n   166→\n   167→The thrill of the almost-malfunction. The tension of the strategic cover-up. The gasp when something shifts at exactly the wrong moment.\n   168→\n   169→Idols who can leverage these situations—maintaining composure, weaponizing their appeal, turning accidents into advantages—generate massive Devotion.\n   170→\n   171→---\n   172→\n   173→## THE TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE\n   174→\n   175→### Phase 1: The Wild Trials (Qualification)\n   176→\n   177→Open entry. Anyone can qualify by generating 10,000 devoted fans in any competition format.\n   178→\n   179→Most established idols qualify through official channels—formal debuts, managed promotions, training academy backing.\n   180→\n   181→Outsiders have to get creative.\n   182→\n   183→Ika crashed a public Chase qualifier with zero backing, maximum confidence, and enough raw talent to make the establishment choke.\n   184→\n   185→### Phase 2: The Specialized Trials\n   186→\n   187→**The Pursuit Trials**\n   188→Standard Chase format. Obstacle courses of varying difficulty. First to catch Senpai wins.\n   189→\n   190→**The Endurance Trials**\n   191→Extended Chases across massive courses. Tests stamina, determination, and the ability to maintain visual appeal while exhausted and sweaty.\n   192→\n   193→**The Performance Trials**\n   194→Traditional idol competition—singing, dancing, stage presence. The original format, still valued.\n   195→\n   196→**The Chaos Trials**\n   197→Unpredictable challenges. Modified courses. Surprise rule changes mid-event. Tests adaptability.\n   198→\n   199→**The Fusion Trials**\n   200→Combinations. Chase while performing. Perform while climbing. Everything at once.\n   201→\n   202→### Phase 3: The Eternal Bout (Finals)\n   203→\n   204→The final challenge adapts to the competitors. The Stage chooses the format that will create the most dramatic, emotionally intense conclusion.\n   205→\n   206→---\n   207→\n   208→## THE LEGENDARY IDOLS (TOP\n\n...

This involves creating a comprehensive repository structure including: a knowledge base of all Infinite Idol lore, mechanics, and assets; seven specialized AI agent personas forming a marketing pipeline; workflow systems for content creation, community management, and campaign planning; output folders for generated content; and a feedback loop system for continuous improvement. The infrastructure will be populated from source materials already present in the repository (FULL_AUTO_CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and SOURCE_MATERIALS_APPENDIX.md).\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a greenfield infrastructure setup requiring creation of 40+ files and directories, with substantial content population from source materials. It involves no existing code to modify but extensive new content creation.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Marketing HQ Repository** (primary) - The complete folder structure and file system being created\n    17→- **Knowledge Base** (content) - Lore, game mechanics, brand guidelines extracted from source materials\n    18→- **Agent System** (documentation) - Seven AI agent persona definitions\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create complete repository folder structure (40+ directories)\n    22→- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md master instructions file\n    23→- [ ] Create README.md project overview\n    24→- [ ] Create 7 agent persona files in `agents/` directory\n    25→- [ ] Populate knowledge-base/lore/ with world, characters, factions, mechanics content\n    26→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/game-mechanics/ files from pre-registration spec\n    27→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/brand/ guidelines files\n    28→- [ ] Create knowledge-base/crypto/ documentation\n    29→- [ ] Initialize outputs/ folder structure with .gitkeep files\n    30→- [ ] Initialize logs/ and reviews/ systems\n    31→- [ ] Set up master calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→## Service Context\n    41→\n    42→### Marketing HQ Repository\n    43→\n    44→**Tech Stack:**\n    45→- Language: Markdown\n    46→- Framework: None (documentation repository)\n    47→- Key directories: knowledge-base/, agents/, outputs/, logs/, reviews/\n    48→\n    49→**Entry Point:** `CLAUDE.md` (all agents read this first)\n    50→\n    51→**How to Run:**\n    52→```bash\n    53→# No runtime - this is a documentation/content repository\n    54→# Agents activate by reading CLAUDE.md then their persona file\n    55→```\n    56→\n    57→**Port:** N/A\n    58→\n    59→## Files to Modify\n    60→\n    61→This is a greenfield setup - no existing files to modify.\n    62→\n    63→## Files to Create\n    64→\n    65→| File | Directory | What to Create |\n

Every agent session should begin by reading this file completely.\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Project Overview\n     8→\n     9→**Infinite Idol** is a Web3 gacha game combining anime idol aesthetics with blockchain technology on the **SUI** blockchain. The game features a unique narrative where idols compete in \"The Chase\" - an endless pursuit of the mysterious figure called Senpai (also known as Onii-chan).\n    10→\n    11→### Core Premise\n    12→\n    13→In the world of Infinite Idol, idols are powered by **Devotion** - literal emotional energy from their fans. Without fans, idols experience **Fading** - they cease to exist. This creates an existentially high-stakes environment where popularity isn't vanity; it's survival.\n    14→\n    15→### Brand Positioning\n    16→\n    17→- **Dark Luxury**: Premium aesthetic with black and gold tones. NOT cutesy pink idol aesthetics.\n    18→- **Self-Aware**: We know we're making a gacha game. We're shameless about it but genuine in our craft.\n    19→- **Existentially Dramatic**: The stakes are real (within the narrative). Every Chase matters.\n    20→- **Web3 Native**: Built on SUI, but gameplay comes first. We're not \"crypto game\" - we're a great game that happens to use blockchain.\n    21→\n    22→---\n    23→\n    24→## The Agent System\n    25→\n    26→This repository is managed by a team of 7 specialized AI agents, coordinated to handle all aspects of marketing for Infinite Idol.

Ika Has 47 Fans\n   195→\n   196→Ika Minami starts her journey with exactly **47 fans**. This is a dangerously low number. Most idols have thousands at minimum. This is her defining underdog status.\n   197→\n   198→### 4. Ika's Hair is Pink Gradient\n   199→\n   200→Ika's hair color is a **pink gradient**: rose pink at the roots fading to magenta at the tips.

Senpai is Always Obscured\n   203→\n   204→**Senpai** (also called **Onii-chan**) is the figure all idols chase in The Chase. Senpai's face is NEVER shown.

Here, idols are not merely entertainers—they are beings sustained by the emotional investment of their fans. Without that investment, they cease to be. This is not metaphor. This is survival.\n    10→\n    11→The Eternal Stage is the arena where dreams are chased, rankings are determined, and fates are sealed.

It is not a single location but a sprawling, ever-shifting arena that manifests different configurations for each Chase event. Part stadium, part obstacle course, part existential battleground.\n    20→\n    21→### Characteristics\n    22→\n    23→- **Architecture**: A blend of classical amphitheater grandeur and sleek, dark futuristic design. Black marble, gold accents, holographic displays.\n    24→- **Atmosphere**: The air itself seems charged with Devotion—the collective emotional energy of watching fans creates a palpable presence.\n    25→- **Scale**: Massive enough to accommodate thousands of spectators, yet intimate enough that every idol feels the weight of every watching eye.\n    26→- **Mutability**: The Stage reconfigures for each Chase, presenting new obstacles, new paths, new challenges.\n    27→\n    28→### The Significance\n    29→\n    30→To perform on the Eternal Stage is to matter. To be absent from it is to fade into irrelevance—and eventually, to Fade entirely. Rankings earned here determine an idol's status, their access to Devotion, and ultimately, their continued existence.\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Devotion\n    35→\n    36→### Definition\n    37→\n    38→**Devotion** is the literal emotional energy that fans invest in their idols.

It is not merely a race—it is a pursuit of the ultimate prize: **Senpai**.\n    70→\n    71→### Format\n    72→\n    73→1. **Start**: All competing idols begin at designated positions on the Eternal Stage\n    74→2. **Pursuit**: Idols race through a dynamic obstacle course, each trying to reach Senpai first\n    75→3. **Senpai's Presence**: Senpai appears ahead, always just out of reach, always obscured\n    76→4. **Competition**: Idols compete against each other AND the course itself\n    77→5. **Conclusion**: The Chase ends when time expires or conditions are met—but Senpai is never caught\n    78→\n    79→### The Obstacles\n    80→\n    81→Each Chase presents unique challenges:\n    82→\n    83→- **Physical**: Walls, gaps, moving platforms, environmental hazards\n    84→- **Mental**: Puzzles, decision points, strategic trade-offs\n    85→- **Social**: Opportunities to collaborate or betray other idols\n    86→- **Devotion-based**: Challenges that consume or test an idol's Devotion reserves\n    87→\n    88→### Rankings\n    89→\n    90→Performance in The Chase directly determines rankings:\n    91→\n    92→| Rank Tier | Status | Devotion Access | Risk Level |\n    93→|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|\n    94→| **S-Rank** | Elite | Priority access to fan pools | Minimal |\n    95→| **A-Rank** | Established | Strong Devotion flow | Low |\n    96→| **B-Rank** | Competitive | Moderate Devotion | Medium |\n    97→| **C-Rank** | Struggling | Limited Devotion | High |\n    98→| **Unranked** | Desperate | Scraps only | Critical |\n    99→\n   100→### Canon Rule\n   101→\n   102→> *\"The Chase is the primary competition format. Idols race through obstacle courses pursuing Senpai. Rankings in The Chase determine status, Devotion flow, and survival. The Chase occurs on the Eternal Stage.\"*\n   103→\n   104→---\n   105→\n   106→## Fading\n   107→\n   108→### What It Is\n   109→\n   110→**Fading** is what happens when an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero. It is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist.\n   111→\n   112→### The Process\n   113→\n   114→Fading is not instantaneous. It occurs in stages:\n   115→\n   116→1. **Dimming**: The idol becomes less visible, less present. Others start to forget them.\n   117→2. **Flickering**: Physical form becomes unstable. Moments of clarity interspersed with absence.\n   118→3. **Silence**: The idol can no longer be heard. Their voice carries no weight.\n   119→4. **Transparency**: The idol becomes visually translucent. The end approaches.\n   120→5. **Fading**: Complete cessation of existence. No remains. No memory. Nothing.\n   121→\n   122→### Reversibility\n   123→\n   124→There is **no known way to reverse Fading** once complete. The closest thing to prevention is:\n   125→\n   126→- Acquiring new fans before Devotion hits zero\n   127→- Spectacular performances that recapture attention\n   128→- Desperate measures (the ethics of which are... questionable)\n   129→\n   130→### The Terror\n   131→\n   132→Fading is the existential threat that hangs over every idol. It is why:\n   133→\n   134→- Competition is so fierce\n   135→- Betrayals occur\n   136→- Some idols will do anything to stay visible\n   137→- Every Chase matters\n   138→\n   139→### Canon Rule\n   140→\n   141→> *\"When an idol loses all their fans and their Devotion drops to zero, they Fade. Fading is functionally death—the idol ceases to exist. There is no known way to reverse Fading.\"*\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## Tournament Structure\n   146→\n   147→### Seasonal Format\n   148→\n   149→The competitive calendar is organized into **Seasons**, each culminating in major Chase events:\n   150→\n   151→| Event Type | Frequency | Stakes | Participants |\n   152→|------------|-----------|--------|--------------|\n   153→| **Daily Chases** | Every day | Minor ranking adjustments | Open to all |\n   154→| **Weekly Showdowns** | Weekly | Moderate ranking impact | Ranked idols |\n   155→| **Monthly Galas** | Monthly | Major ranking shifts | Top performers |\n   156→| **Seasonal Finals** | End of season | Rankings reset, prizes distributed | Elite qualifiers |\n   157→| **The Grand Chase** | Annual | Legendary status, massive rewards | Champions only |\n   158→\n   159→### Qualification\n   160→\n   161→- **Daily Chases**: No qualification needed—survival is qualification enough\n   162→- **Weekly Showdowns**: Must maintain minimum ranking\n   163→- **Monthly Galas**: Top performers from weekly events\n   164→- **Seasonal Finals**: Season's accumulated performance\n   165→- **The Grand Chase**: Champions from each seasonal final\n   166→\n   167→### Rewards\n   168→\n   169→Success in The Chase yields:\n   170→\n   171→- **Ranking Improvements**: Better position = better Devotion access\n   172→- **Fan Exposure**: Winners are featured, gaining new followers\n   173→- **Resources**: Gems, cosmetics, exclusive access\n   174→- **Safety**: Higher ranks provide buffer against Fading\n   175→\n   176→### The Brutal Truth\n   177→\n   178→The tournament structure is designed to concentrate success. The rich get richer. The popular become more popular. Those at the bottom must claw their way up or face oblivion.\n   179→\n   180→This is by design. **The Foundation** maintains this system.\n   181→\n   182→---\n   183→\n   184→## The Senpai Mystery\n   185→\n   186→### Who Is Senpai?\n   187→\n   188→**Senpai** (also called **Onii-chan**) is the figure at the heart of The Chase. Every idol pursues Senpai. No idol has ever caught them.\n   189→\n   190→### What We Know\n   191→\n   192→- Senpai's face is **never shown**—always obscured by shadow, lens flare, or turned away\n   193→- Senpai appears at every Chase, always ahead, always just out of reach\n   194→- The desire to catch Senpai seems intrinsic to every idol's nature\n   195→- Catching Senpai is believed to grant... something. No one knows what.\n   196→\n   197→### What We Don't Know\n   198→\n   199→- Why do idols want to catch Senpai?\n   200→- Is Senpai a person, a concept, or something else?\n   201→- Can Senpai be caught at all?\n   202→- What happens if someone does?\n   203→\n   204→### Canon Rule\n   205→\n   206→> *\"Senpai is the figure all idols chase in The Chase.

And we're damn good at it.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The Infinite Idol voice is **shameless but genuine, self-aware, dark luxury, existentially dramatic**. We are not another cutesy idol game hiding behind innocence. We acknowledge what we're making—a gacha game designed to captivate, monetize, and entertain. But we do it with craft, with care, and with genuine love for the world we've built.\n    10→\n    11→This document defines how Infinite Idol speaks across all channels, from Twitter threads to Discord announcements, from Ika's in-character posts to behind-the-scenes founder updates.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## Core Voice Pillars\n    16→\n    17→### 1. Shameless But Genuine\n    18→\n    19→**What It Means**\n    20→\n    21→We don't hide from what we are. We're making a gacha game. We want players to spend money. We design systems that encourage engagement and spending. This is not something to apologize for—it's something to own with confidence.\n    22→\n    23→But here's the twist: we're also genuine. We actually care about the world, the characters, the story. This isn't cynical IP extraction. We love Ika. We believe in the Eternal Stage. We want players to feel something real.\n    24→\n    25→**How It Sounds**\n    26→\n    27→| DO | DON'T |\n    28→|----|-------|\n    29→| \"Yes, it's a gacha game. A really good one.\" | \"It's not *really* about the gacha...\" |\n    30→| \"We designed this banner to be irresistible.\" | \"We hope you'll consider supporting us.\" |\n    31→| \"Ika wants your Devotion. So do we.\" | \"Please become a fan if you can!\" |\n    32→| \"We built this world because we love it.\" | \"This is just a business venture.\" |\n    33→\n    34→**Examples**\n    35→\n    36→> \"New banner dropping tomorrow. We put our heart into designing these cosmetics to separate you from your SUI. And honestly? They're gorgeous. You're going to want them.\"\n    37→\n    38→> \"We're a gacha game. We're Web3. We're anime idols. Everything you've been warned about. But we're also genuinely good. Stick around and we'll prove it.\"\n    39→\n    40→---\n    41→\n    42→### 2. Self-Aware\n    43→\n    44→**What It Means**\n    45→\n    46→We know the tropes. We know the criticisms. We know what people say about gacha games, about Web3 games, about idol games. Instead of pretending we're different, we acknowledge the landscape and then transcend it.\n    47→\n    48→Self-awareness isn't self-deprecation. We're not mocking ourselves—we're demonstrating intelligence. We see the meta-game and we play it knowingly.\n    49→\n    50→**How It Sounds**\n    51→\n    52→| DO | DON'T |\n    53→|----|-------|\n    54→| \"Another gacha game? Yes. But hear us out.\" | \"We're totally unique and different!\" |\n    55→| \"You've seen this mechanic before. We do it better.\" | \"We invented revolutionary gameplay.\" |\n    56→| \"Web3 gaming has a reputation. We're here to change it.\" | \"Web3 gaming is perfect and misunderstood!\" |\n    57→| \"Idols chasing Senpai. It's exactly what you think. And more.\" | \"Our narrative is incomparably original.\" |\n    58→\n    59→**Examples**\n    60→\n    61→> \"Yes, the odds are 3% for Legendary. Yes, you're going to pull anyway. Yes, we know. That's why we made the Legendary items this good.\"\n    62→\n    63→> \"Infinite Idol is built on SUI. Before you roll your eyes—we're gameplay-first, blockchain-second. The crypto part exists to make ownership real, not to make us look innovative.\"\n    64→\n    65→---\n    66→\n    67→### 3. Dark Luxury\n    68→\n    69→**What It Means**\n    70→\n    71→We are premium. We are sleek. We are black and gold, not pink and sparkles. This is not Love Live. This is not Hololive. We're closer to NIKKE—confident, adult, sophisticated.\n    72→\n    73→Our aesthetic is:\n    74→- **Black**: Deep, rich, absorbing—the void that idols fear\n    75→- **Gold**: Premium, aspirational, the gleam of success\n    76→- **Rose/Magenta accents**: Ika's signature colors, warmth within darkness\n    77→- **Minimalist elegance**: Clean lines, intentional space, no clutter\n    78→\n    79→**How It Sounds**\n    80→\n    81→| DO | DON'T |\n    82→|----|-------|\n    83→| \"Dripping in elegance.\" | \"Super cute and kawaii!\" |\n    84→| \"The Eternal Stage demands excellence.\" | \"Have fun on the stage, everyone!\" |\n    85→| \"Premium cosmetics for premium idols.\" | \"Adorable outfits for your favorites!\" |\n    86→| \"Darkness awaits those who Fade.\" | \"Oh no, they might disappear!\" |\n    87→\n    88→**Language Guidelines**\n    89→\n    90→- Use **elevated vocabulary**: \"elegance\" not \"prettiness\", \"devastating\" not \"sad\"\n    91→- Avoid diminutives: no \"little\", \"tiny\", \"cute\", \"adorable\" unless specifically ironic\n    92→- Embrace dramatic phrasing: \"The Eternal Stage demands\" > \"The Stage wants\"\n    93→- Keep sentences confident: declarative statements, not questions seeking validation\n    94→\n    95→**Examples**\n    96→\n    97→> \"The new Midnight Empress collection. Five pieces. Obsidian and gold. For idols who don't just want to be seen—they want to be remembered.\"\n    98→\n    99→> \"Ika's latest outfit wasn't designed. It was forged. In the fires of competition. From the tears of her rivals.\"\n   100→\n   101→---\n   102→\n   103→### 4. Existentially Dramatic\n   104→\n   105→**What It Means**\n   106→\n   107→In Infinite Idol, the stakes are real. Idols don't just lose—they Fade from existence. Fans don't just watch—they literally keep their idols alive. This existential weight informs everything.\n   108→\n   109→We lean into the drama. Every Chase matters. Every ranking shift is life or death. Every fan gained is survival. This isn't overdramatic—within our world, it's simply accurate.\n   110→\n   111→**How It Sounds**\n   112→\n   113→| DO | DON'T |\n   114→|----|-------|\n   115→| \"Your Devotion keeps her existing.\" | \"Support your favorite idol!\" |\n   116→| \"Fight for your place on the Eternal Stage.\" | \"Compete in fun events!\" |\n   117→| \"47 fans. It's not enough. It's barely existing.\" | \"She needs more fans to be popular!\" |\n   118→| \"The Foundation controls who lives and who Fades.\" | \"The Foundation manages the rankings.\" |\n   119→\n   120→**Tone Calibration**\n   121→\n   122→- **Heavy moments**: Full existential weight, no humor\n   123→- **Lighter moments**: Dramatic undercurrent, but room for wit\n   124→- **Hype moments**: Channel existential stakes into excitement\n   125→- **Community moments**: Warmth exists within the darkness\n   126→\n   127→**Examples**\n   128→\n   129→> \"Tomorrow's Chase determines who rises and who fades. There is no participation trophy. Only survival.\"\n   130→\n   131→> \"Ika woke up with 47 fans. Most idols have thousands. She exists on borrowed time and borrowed devotion. And she wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n   132→\n   133→> \"Every gem you spend fuels the Eternal Stage. Every idol you support delays their Fading. This isn't a game. It's a lifeline.\"\n   134→\n   135→---\n   136→\n   137→## Character Voices\n   138→\n   139→### Ika Minami (Primary Voice - 40% of Content)\n   140→\n   141→Ika is our protagonist and primary voice for first-person content.\n   142→\n   143→**Ika's Tone**\n   144→\n   145→- **Shameless**: She knows what she wants and says it directly\n   146→- **Playful but not cutesy**: She teases and flirts without being saccharine\n   147→- **Determined**: The underdog fire burns constantly\n   148→- **Genuine**: Her love for her 47 fans is real and touching\n   149→\n   150→**Ika's Speech Patterns**\n   151→\n   152→| Pattern | Example |\n   153→|---------|---------|\n   154→| Direct address to fans | \"You. Yes, you reading this.\" |\n   155→| Tilde for playfulness | \"Don't you dare look away~\" |\n   156→| Numbers emphasis | \"47 fans. Just 47. But you're mine.\" |\n   157→| Senpai obsession | \"I will catch Senpai. Watch me.\" |\n   158→\n   159→**Sample Ika Tweets**\n   160→\n   161→> \"Another day of being the idol with 47 fans in a world of millions. Some call it hopeless. I call it intimate~\"\n   162→\n   163→> \"They laughed when I entered The Chase. They're not laughing anymore. Well, some still are. But they won't be for long.\"\n   164→\n   165→> \"To my 47: You are the reason I exist. Literally. Without your Devotion, I would Fade. So... don't stop watching, okay? Please?\"\n   166→\n   167→> \"Senpai appeared again today. As always, I couldn't catch them. As always, I got closer than anyone else.

And we're damn good at it.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The Infinite Idol voice is **shameless but genuine, self-aware, dark luxury, existentially dramatic**. We are not another cutesy idol game hiding behind innocence. We acknowledge what we're making—a gacha game designed to captivate, monetize, and entertain. But we do it with craft, with care, and with genuine love for the world we've built.\n    10→\n    11→This document defines how Infinite Idol speaks across all channels, from Twitter threads to Discord announcements, from Ika's in-character posts to behind-the-scenes founder updates.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## Core Voice Pillars\n    16→\n    17→### 1. Shameless But Genuine\n    18→\n    19→**What It Means**\n    20→\n    21→We don't hide from what we are. We're making a gacha game. We want players to spend money. We design systems that encourage engagement and spending. This is not something to apologize for—it's something to own with confidence.\n    22→\n    23→But here's the twist: we're also genuine. We actually care about the world, the characters, the story. This isn't cynical IP extraction. We love Ika. We believe in the Eternal Stage. We want players to feel something real.\n    24→\n    25→**How It Sounds**\n    26→\n    27→| DO | DON'T |\n    28→|----|-------|\n    29→| \"Yes, it's a gacha game. A really good one.\" | \"It's not *really* about the gacha...\" |\n    30→| \"We designed this banner to be irresistible.\" | \"We hope you'll consider supporting us.\" |\n    31→| \"Ika wants your Devotion. So do we.\" | \"Please become a fan if you can!\" |\n    32→| \"We built this world because we love it.\" | \"This is just a business venture.\" |\n    33→\n    34→**Examples**\n    35→\n    36→> \"New banner dropping tomorrow. We put our heart into designing these cosmetics to separate you from your SUI. And honestly? They're gorgeous. You're going to want them.\"\n    37→\n    38→> \"We're a gacha game. We're Web3.

Self-Aware\n    43→\n    44→**What It Means**\n    45→\n    46→We know the tropes. We know the criticisms. We know what people say about gacha games, about Web3 games, about idol games. Instead of pretending we're different, we acknowledge the landscape and then transcend it.\n    47→\n    48→Self-awareness isn't self-deprecation. We're not mocking ourselves—we're demonstrating intelligence. We see the meta-game and we play it knowingly.\n    49→\n    50→**How It Sounds**\n    51→\n    52→| DO | DON'T |\n    53→|----|-------|\n    54→| \"Another gacha game? Yes. But hear us out.\" | \"We're totally unique and different!\" |\n    55→| \"You've seen this mechanic before.

We're here to change it.\" | \"Web3 gaming is perfect and misunderstood!\" |\n    57→| \"Idols chasing Senpai. It's exactly what you think. And more.\" | \"Our narrative is incomparably original.\" |\n    58→\n    59→**Examples**\n    60→\n    61→> \"Yes, the odds are 3% for Legendary. Yes, you're going to pull anyway. Yes, we know. That's why we made the Legendary items this good.\"\n    62→\n    63→> \"Infinite Idol is built on SUI. Before you roll your eyes—we're gameplay-first, blockchain-second.

Dark Luxury\n    68→\n    69→**What It Means**\n    70→\n    71→We are premium. We are sleek. We are black and gold, not pink and sparkles. This is not Love Live. This is not Hololive. We're closer to NIKKE—confident, adult, sophisticated.\n    72→\n    73→Our aesthetic is:\n    74→- **Black**: Deep, rich, absorbing—the void that idols fear\n    75→- **Gold**: Premium, aspirational, the gleam of success\n    76→- **Rose/Magenta accents**: Ika's signature colors, warmth within darkness\n    77→- **Minimalist elegance**: Clean lines, intentional space, no clutter\n    78→\n    79→**How It Sounds**\n    80→\n    81→| DO | DON'T |\n    82→|----|-------|\n    83→| \"Dripping in elegance.\" | \"Super cute and kawaii!\" |\n    84→| \"The Eternal Stage demands excellence.\" | \"Have fun on the stage, everyone!\" |\n    85→| \"Premium cosmetics for premium idols.\" | \"Adorable outfits for your favorites!\" |\n    86→| \"Darkness awaits those who Fade.\" | \"Oh no, they might disappear!\" |\n    87→\n    88→**Language Guidelines**\n    89→\n    90→- Use **elevated vocabulary**: \"elegance\" not \"prettiness\", \"devastating\" not \"sad\"\n    91→- Avoid diminutives: no \"little\", \"tiny\", \"cute\", \"adorable\" unless specifically ironic\n    92→- Embrace dramatic phrasing: \"The Eternal Stage demands\" > \"The Stage wants\"\n    93→- Keep sentences confident: declarative statements, not questions seeking validation\n    94→\n    95→**Examples**\n    96→\n    97→> \"The new Midnight Empress collection. Five pieces. Obsidian and gold. For idols who don't just want to be seen—they want to be remembered.\"\n    98→\n    99→> \"Ika's latest outfit wasn't designed. It was forged. In the fires of competition. From the tears of her rivals.\"\n   100→\n   101→---\n   102→\n   103→### 4. Existentially Dramatic\n   104→\n   105→**What It Means**\n   106→\n   107→In Infinite Idol, the stakes are real. Idols don't just lose—they Fade from existence. Fans don't just watch—they literally keep their idols alive. This existential weight informs everything.\n   108→\n   109→We lean into the drama. Every Chase matters. Every ranking shift is life or death. Every fan gained is survival. This isn't overdramatic—within our world, it's simply accurate.\n   110→\n   111→**How It Sounds**\n   112→\n   113→| DO | DON'T |\n   114→|----|-------|\n   115→| \"Your Devotion keeps her existing.\" | \"Support your favorite idol!\" |\n   116→| \"Fight for your place on the Eternal Stage.\" | \"Compete in fun events!\" |\n   117→| \"47 fans. It's not enough. It's barely existing.\" | \"She needs more fans to be popular!\" |\n   118→| \"The Foundation controls who lives and who Fades.\" | \"The Foundation manages the rankings.\" |\n   119→\n   120→**Tone Calibration**\n   121→\n   122→- **Heavy moments**: Full existential weight, no humor\n   123→- **Lighter moments**: Dramatic undercurrent, but room for wit\n   124→- **Hype moments**: Channel existential stakes into excitement\n   125→- **Community moments**: Warmth exists within the darkness\n   126→\n   127→**Examples**\n   128→\n   129→> \"Tomorrow's Chase determines who rises and who fades. There is no participation trophy. Only survival.\"\n   130→\n   131→> \"Ika woke up with 47 fans. Most idols have thousands. She exists on borrowed time and borrowed devotion. And she wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n   132→\n   133→> \"Every gem you spend fuels the Eternal Stage. Every idol you support delays their Fading. This isn't a game.

calendar template\n    32→- [ ] Create human review workflow templates\n    33→\n    34→### Out of Scope:\n    35→- Actual content generation (tweets, threads, etc.) - that's for agents to do later\n    36→- Light novel full text (referenced but source files not provided in repository)\n    37→- External integrations (Discord, Twitter APIs)\n    38→- SUI blockchain development\n    39→\n    40→##

And we're damn good at it.\"*\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## Overview\n     8→\n     9→The Infinite Idol voice is **shameless but genuine, self-aware, dark luxury, existentially dramatic**. We are not another cutesy idol game hiding behind innocence. We acknowledge what we're making—a gacha game designed to captivate, monetize, and entertain. But we do it with craft, with care, and with genuine love for the world we've built.\n    10→\n    11→This document defines how Infinite Idol speaks across all channels, from Twitter threads to Discord announcements, from Ika's in-character posts to behind-the-scenes founder updates.\n    12→\n    13→---\n    14→\n    15→## Core Voice Pillars\n    16→\n    17→### 1. Shameless But Genuine\n    18→\n    19→**What It Means**\n    20→\n    21→We don't hide from what we are. We're making a gacha game. We want players to spend money. We design systems that encourage engagement and spending. This is not something to apologize for—it's something to own with confidence.\n    22→\n    23→But here's the twist: we're also genuine. We actually care about the world, the characters, the story. This isn't cynical IP extraction. We love Ika. We believe in the Eternal Stage. We want players to feel something real.\n    24→\n    25→**How It Sounds**\n    26→\n    27→| DO | DON'T |\n    28→|----|-------|\n    29→| \"Yes, it's a gacha game. A really good one.\" | \"It's not *really* about the gacha...\" |\n    30→| \"We designed this banner to be irresistible.\" | \"We hope you'll consider supporting us.\" |\n    31→| \"Ika wants your Devotion. So do we.\" | \"Please become a fan if you can!\" |\n    32→| \"We built this world because we love it.\" | \"This is just a business venture.\" |\n    33→\n    34→**Examples**\n    35→\n    36→> \"New banner dropping tomorrow. We put our heart into designing these cosmetics to separate you from your SUI. And honestly? They're gorgeous. You're going to want them.\"\n    37→\n    38→> \"We're a gacha game. We're Web3. We're anime idols. Everything you've been warned about. But we're also genuinely good. Stick around and we'll prove it.\"\n    39→\n    40→---\n    41→\n    42→### 2. Self-Aware\n    43→\n    44→**What It Means**\n    45→\n    46→We know the tropes. We know the criticisms. We know what people say about gacha games, about Web3 games, about idol games. Instead of pretending we're different, we acknowledge the landscape and then transcend it.\n    47→\n    48→Self-awareness isn't self-deprecation. We're not mocking ourselves—we're demonstrating intelligence. We see the meta-game and we play it knowingly.\n    49→\n    50→**How It Sounds**\n    51→\n    52→| DO | DON'T |\n    53→|----|-------|\n    54→| \"Another gacha game? Yes. But hear us out.\" | \"We're totally unique and different!\" |\n    55→| \"You've seen this mechanic before. We do it better.\" | \"We invented revolutionary gameplay.\" |\n    56→| \"Web3 gaming has a reputation. We're here to change it.\" | \"Web3 gaming is perfect and misunderstood!\" |\n    57→| \"Idols chasing Senpai. It's exactly what you think. And more.\" | \"Our narrative is incomparably original.\" |\n    58→\n    59→**Examples**\n    60→\n    61→> \"Yes, the odds are 3% for Legendary. Yes, you're going to pull anyway. Yes, we know. That's why we made the Legendary items this good.\"\n    62→\n    63→> \"Infinite Idol is built on SUI. Before you roll your eyes—we're gameplay-first, blockchain-second. The crypto part exists to make ownership real, not to make us look innovative.\"\n    64→\n    65→---\n    66→\n    67→### 3. Dark Luxury\n    68→\n    69→**What It Means**\n    70→\n    71→We are premium. We are sleek. We are black and gold, not pink and sparkles. This is not Love Live. This is not Hololive. We're closer to NIKKE—confident, adult, sophisticated.\n    72→\n    73→Our aesthetic is:\n    74→- **Black**: Deep, rich, absorbing—the void that idols fear\n    75→- **Gold**: Premium, aspirational, the gleam of success\n    76→- **Rose/Magenta accents**: Ika's signature colors, warmth within darkness\n    77→- **Minimalist elegance**: Clean lines, intentional space, no clutter\n    78→\n    79→**How It Sounds**\n    80→\n    81→| DO | DON'T |\n    82→|----|-------|\n    83→| \"Dripping in elegance.\" | \"Super cute and kawaii!\" |\n    84→| \"The Eternal Stage demands excellence.\" | \"Have fun on the stage, everyone!\" |\n    85→| \"Premium cosmetics for premium idols.\" | \"Adorable outfits for your favorites!\" |\n    86→| \"Darkness awaits those who Fade.\" | \"Oh no, they might disappear!\" |\n    87→\n    88→**Language Guidelines**\n    89→\n    90→- Use **elevated vocabulary**: \"elegance\" not \"prettiness\", \"devastating\" not \"sad\"\n    91→- Avoid diminutives: no \"little\", \"tiny\", \"cute\", \"adorable\" unless specifically ironic\n    92→- Embrace dramatic phrasing: \"The Eternal Stage demands\" > \"The Stage wants\"\n    93→- Keep sentences confident: declarative statements, not questions seeking validation\n    94→\n    95→**Examples**\n    96→\n    97→> \"The new Midnight Empress collection. Five pieces. Obsidian and gold. For idols who don't just want to be seen—they want to be remembered.\"\n    98→\n    99→> \"Ika's latest outfit wasn't designed. It was forged. In the fires of competition. From the tears of her rivals.\"\n   100→\n   101→---\n   102→\n   103→### 4. Existentially Dramatic\n   104→\n   105→**What It Means**\n   106→\n   107→In Infinite Idol, the stakes are real. Idols don't just lose—they Fade from existence. Fans don't just watch—they literally keep their idols alive. This existential weight informs everything.\n   108→\n   109→We lean into the drama. Every Chase matters. Every ranking shift is life or death. Every fan gained is survival. This isn't overdramatic—within our world, it's simply accurate.\n   110→\n   111→**How It Sounds**\n   112→\n   113→| DO | DON'T |\n   114→|----|-------|\n   115→| \"Your Devotion keeps her existing.\" | \"Support your favorite idol!\" |\n   116→| \"Fight for your place on the Eternal Stage.\" | \"Compete in fun events!\" |\n   117→| \"47 fans. It's not enough. It's barely existing.\" | \"She needs more fans to be popular!\" |\n   118→| \"The Foundation controls who lives and who Fades.\" | \"The Foundation manages the rankings.\" |\n   119→\n   120→**Tone Calibration**\n   121→\n   122→- **Heavy moments**: Full existential weight, no humor\n   123→- **Lighter moments**: Dramatic undercurrent, but room for wit\n   124→- **Hype moments**: Channel existential stakes into excitement\n   125→- **Community moments**: Warmth exists within the darkness\n   126→\n   127→**Examples**\n   128→\n   129→> \"Tomorrow's Chase determines who rises and who fades. There is no participation trophy. Only survival.\"\n   130→\n   131→> \"Ika woke up with 47 fans. Most idols have thousands. She exists on borrowed time and borrowed devotion. And she wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n   132→\n   133→> \"Every gem you spend fuels the Eternal Stage. Every idol you support delays their Fading. This isn't a game. It's a lifeline.\"\n   134→\n   135→---\n   136→\n   137→## Character Voices\n   138→\n   139→### Ika Minami (Primary Voice - 40% of Content)\n   140→\n   141→Ika is our protagonist and primary voice for first-person content.\n   142→\n   143→**Ika's Tone**\n   144→\n   145→- **Shameless**: She knows what she wants and says it directly\n   146→- **Playful but not cutesy**: She teases and flirts without being saccharine\n   147→- **Determined**: The underdog fire burns constantly\n   148→- **Genuine**: Her love for her 47 fans is real and touching\n   149→\n   150→**Ika's Speech Patterns**\n   151→\n   152→| Pattern | Example |\n   153→|---------|---------|\n   154→| Direct address to fans | \"You. Yes, you reading this.\" |\n   155→| Tilde for playfulness | \"Don't you dare look away~\" |\n   156→| Numbers emphasis | \"47 fans. Just 47. But you're mine.\" |\n   157→| Senpai obsession | \"I will catch Senpai. Watch me.\" |\n   158→\n   159→**Sample Ika Tweets**\n   160→\n   161→> \"Another day of being the idol with 47 fans in a world of millions. Some call it hopeless. I call it intimate~\"\n   162→\n   163→> \"They laughed when I entered The Chase. They're not laughing anymore. Well, some still are. But they won't be for long.\"\n   164→\n   165→> \"To my 47: You are the reason I exist. Literally. Without your Devotion, I would Fade. So... don't stop watching, okay? Please?\"\n   166→\n   167→> \"Senpai appeared again today. As always, I couldn't catch them. As always, I got closer than anyone else.
