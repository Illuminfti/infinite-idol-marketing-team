# INFINITE IDOL - Volume 2: The Fall

*"Some systems are too big to fail. Until they aren't."*

---


**Prologue: The Girl Who Built a Promise**

*Three months before the Fall.*

Runa stood at the center of her creation, watching the threads of light
weave between her fingers.

Each thread was a connection. A promise. A smaller idol who had trusted
her with their existence, their Devotion streams flowing through her
network like tributaries into a great river.

Forty-seven idols. Forty-seven lives depending on her system.

"The numbers are beautiful," she whispered to herself. "As long as
everyone stays connected, no one has to Fade alone."

The math was elegant. When one idol had a bad performance, the others
could carry them. When someone stumbled, the network caught them. Shared
risk. Shared reward. Shared survival.

It was perfect.

It had to be perfect.

Because if it wasn't---if the math was wrong, if she'd made an error
somewhere in the beautiful equations---then she hadn't saved anyone.

She'd doomed them all.

Runa pushed the thought away. The numbers didn't lie. The system
worked.

It had to work.

*(The numbers, as it turned out, were lying. But Runa wouldn't discover
this for another three months. By then, it would be far too late.)*

**Chapter 1**

**Afterglow, or: The Calm Before Everything Goes Wrong**

"Absolutely not."

"But Ika---"

"I said no."

"It would really emphasize your---"

"Sora, I am not wearing an outfit that is literally just straps and
prayers."

The fitting room of Celestial Designs---the most prestigious idol
outfitter at the Eternal Stage---had become a battlefield. Fabric
swatches lay scattered like casualties. Measurement tapes hung from
hooks like nooses. And in the center of it all, I stood in what I could
only describe as "aggressive lingerie with athletic pretensions."

"I think it's elegant," Sora said, circling me with the critical eye
of someone who had never met a piece of fabric she couldn't suggest
removing. "Very aerodynamic."

"It's three pieces of string and a logo."

"High-quality string!"

Behind us, Suiren emerged from her own fitting area wearing something
that was technically more coverage but somehow worse. The bodysuit clung
to her like it had made a personal vow, and the strategic cutouts seemed
designed by someone who had studied human anatomy specifically to
identify the most devastating places to show skin.

"This is acceptable," she said flatly.

I stared at her. "How is THAT acceptable but mine isn't?"

"Yours looks like you're trying. Mine looks effortless."

"That's not---that doesn't---" I sputtered. "Sora, back me up
here."

Sora had stopped circling and was now openly staring at Suiren with an
expression that could best be described as "respectfully feral."

"I'm sorry, what were we talking about?"

"Hopeless. You're both hopeless."


---


The fitting session had been Sora's idea---a celebration of our success
in the first tournament arc. We'd made it through the qualifying
rounds, established ourselves as legitimate contenders, and more
importantly, survived someone's attempt to erase me from existence.

Things were looking up.

Which, in retrospect, should have been my first warning sign.

"Okay, okay, serious options." The designer---a harried woman named
Kira who had clearly dealt with difficult idols before---wheeled out a
new rack. "These are more\... substantial."

The outfits were still revealing by any normal standard, but at least
they acknowledged that fabric existed as a concept.

I tried on a pink and black number that actually fit---sports bra
variant, yes, but with actual support. Short shorts that were short but
not theoretical. Thigh-highs that made my legs look approximately seven
miles long.

"Better," I admitted, examining myself in the mirror.

"You look like yourself," Suiren observed. Coming from her, this was
high praise.

"You look like someone I want to chase across an obstacle course,"
Sora added. Coming from her, this was also high praise, just a different
kind.

I was about to respond when the fitting room door slammed open.

Momo burst in, her usually cheerful face pale with something that looked
uncomfortably like fear.

"You need to see this," she said. "Something's wrong with the
network idols."


---


The medical wing of the Eternal Stage wasn't supposed to be crowded.

It was now.

Idols lay on beds, their edges flickering like bad reception. Some were
translucent in places, others had patches where their features
simply\... blurred. The air smelled like static electricity and fear.

"It started an hour ago," Momo explained as we pushed through the
chaos. "Just small glitches at first---a flicker here, a stutter there.
But it's getting worse."

"What's causing it?" I asked.

"No one knows. They're all connected to some kind of shared Devotion
network, but---"

"Runa's network," Suiren said quietly.

I looked at her. "You know about this?"

"I know OF it. A shared system designed to stabilize smaller idols by
pooling their Devotion streams." Her expression was unreadable. "I had
concerns about the architecture."

"Concerns?"

"Single points of failure. Cascade risks." She paused. "Theoretical
concerns. Until now."

A scream cut through the medical wing---raw, terrified, the sound of
someone watching themselves disappear.

We ran toward it.

A young idol, couldn't have been more than sixteen, was sitting up in
bed staring at her hands. They were transparent. You could see the
sheets through them.

"I can't feel them," she sobbed. "I can't feel my hands, they're
not---I'm not---"

A nurse was trying to calm her, but what do you say? What comfort exists
for someone who's watching themselves cease to exist?

"This is wrong," Sora said, her usual energy completely absent. "This
is really, really wrong."

I didn't have a response.

None of us did.


---


We found Runa in a private room at the end of the wing, surrounded by
holographic displays showing cascading numbers in red.

She looked like she hadn't slept in days. Dark circles under her eyes.
Hair disheveled. The sweet, earnest girl I'd seen in broadcasts
replaced by someone running on desperation and caffeine.

"It's not supposed to do this," she muttered, not looking up as we
entered. "The math is right. I checked it a thousand times. The system
should be self-stabilizing."

"Runa," I said gently.

"One weakness creates a cascade, but I accounted for that. I built in
redundancies. I---" She finally looked up, and her eyes were wild. "I
didn't do this wrong. I COULDN'T have done this wrong."

"What's happening to them?" Suiren asked.

"Feedback loop." Runa turned back to her displays, fingers flying.
"When one idol in the network destabilizes, it creates drag on the
others. Usually the system compensates. But something triggered a
cascade---one failure led to two, led to four, led to---"

"How do we stop it?"

"I'm TRYING." Her voice cracked. "I just need to rebalance the load
distribution. If I can isolate the failing nodes and redistribute
their---"

"Runa." I grabbed her shoulders, forced her to look at me. "How many
people are connected to your network?"

She met my eyes.

"Forty-seven," she whispered. "And if I can't fix this, they all
Fade."

The number hit me like a physical blow.

*Forty-seven.*

The same number of fans I'd had before everything changed.

Forty-seven people trusting her system. Forty-seven lives hanging by
threads she was desperately trying to hold together.

"Tell us how to help," I said.

"You can't." Runa pulled away, turning back to her displays. "This
is my system. My math. My responsibility."

"That's not---"

"GO." Her voice broke. "Please. I need to focus. I can fix this. I
just need time."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to grab her and shake her and demand she let
us help.

But Suiren's hand on my arm stopped me.

"She needs to try," Suiren said quietly. "Even if\..."

She didn't finish the sentence.

She didn't have to.

**Chapter 2**

**The Foundation Makes Its Move**

They came the next morning.

We were in our assigned quarters---a modest suite that felt luxurious
compared to my streaming apartment but apparently qualified as
"independent housing" by Eternal Stage standards---when the knock
came.

Not a polite knock. The kind of knock that said "I'm being courteous,
but I don't have to be."

Sora answered the door and immediately went rigid.

"Oh," she said, her voice flat in a way I'd never heard from her.
"It's you."

Four women stood in our doorway, each one more intimidating than the
last.

The first was tall, silver-haired, with the posture of someone who had
never been wrong about anything in her life. She wore a judicial-looking
outfit---clean lines, dark colors, an emblem I didn't recognize on her
collar.

"Arya," Suiren said beside me, and her voice was ice. "I should have
known."

"Suiren." The silver-haired woman---Arya---inclined her head
fractionally. "You look well. The Foundation was disappointed when you
left us."

"The Foundation was disappointed that I developed independent
thought."

"We prefer to think of it as\... suboptimal decision-making." Arya's
smile didn't reach her eyes. "But we're not here to relitigate the
past."

She stepped inside without being invited. The other three followed.

The second was younger, with bright eyes and a cheerful expression that
seemed surgically attached to her face. Pink and red color scheme.
Bouncy energy that felt performed.

"Hi!" She waved. "I'm Opti! I'm really, REALLY hoping we can all be
friends! Optimistically speaking, this conversation is going to go
great!"

The third didn't speak at all. Pale hair, dark outfit, mask covering
the lower half of her face. She moved to the corner of the room and
simply\... watched.

The fourth was corporate polish incarnate---perfect hair, perfect
makeup, perfect smile that made me want to check my wallet.

"Bea," she introduced herself, extending a hand. "I handle
partnerships and opportunity alignment for The Foundation. I think
you'll find our offer very reasonable."

"We haven't heard an offer," I said, not taking her hand.

"Not yet." Arya settled into our best chair like she owned it. "But
you will."


---


"The Foundation," Arya began, "has been the backbone of the idol
industry for three generations."

"The Foundation," I countered, "is a glorified gatekeeping operation
that extracts value from idols while pretending to provide services."

Opti gasped. "That's such a pessimistic way to look at it!"

"It's an accurate way."

"Accuracy and optimism aren't mutually exclusive!" She beamed. "I
optimistically believe you're going to change your mind once you hear
what we're offering!"

Arya held up a hand, silencing her subordinate. "The current situation
with the network idols has created\... instability. Runa's system is
failing. Forty-seven idols are at risk of Fading."

"And?"

"And The Foundation is prepared to intervene. We can stabilize them.
Bring them into our infrastructure. Ensure they survive."

I felt Suiren tense beside me.

"In exchange for what?" she asked.

"Standard contracts." Bea produced a tablet with practiced ease.
"Very reasonable terms. Fifteen-year exclusive management. Devotion
routing through Foundation channels. Brand alignment requirements.
Standard non-compete clauses."

"Fifteen years?" Sora's voice was sharp. "That's---"

"That's survival," Arya cut in. "The alternative is watching them
Fade. One by one. Until there's nothing left."

The masked one in the corner---she still hadn't spoken, still hadn't
moved---shifted slightly. Just enough to remind us she was there.

"You're not here to save them," I said slowly, the pieces clicking
into place. "You're here to acquire them. While they're desperate.
While they'll sign anything."

Arya's smile was thin. "I'm here to offer stability in a time of
chaos. What people choose to call that is their prerogative."

"And us? Why are you really here?"

"Because you're a symbol." For the first time, something genuine
flickered in her expression. "You bypassed our system. Proved you could
succeed without us. As long as you exist, other idols will think they
can do the same."

"They can."

"They can TRY. Most will Fade in the attempt." She stood, smoothing
her outfit. "The Foundation offers structure. Protection. A path to
survival that doesn't require gambling everything on raw talent and
luck."

"It requires signing away your freedom instead."

"Freedom is a luxury of the successful." Arya moved toward the door,
her entourage following. "The offer stands. Join The Foundation. Help
us bring the network idols into the fold. Lend your credibility to our
efforts."

"And if we refuse?"

She paused at the doorway.

"Then you'll watch them Fade, knowing you could have helped." Her
voice was almost gentle. "And when the chaos spreads---because it will
spread---you'll face it alone."

The masked one---Zuri, I assumed---spoke for the first time as she
passed me. Just three words, barely audible:

"She already knows."

Then they were gone.

"What does that mean?" Sora demanded. "What does she already know?"

I had no idea.

But the cold certainty in that voice told me I was going to find out.

**Chapter 3**

**The Girl Who Solved Everything**

We found Runa three days later.

Not in the medical wing. Not at her displays. Not doing anything
productive at all.

She was sitting on the edge of a fountain in the Eternal Stage's
central plaza, watching the water with empty eyes.

"The stabilization failed," she said without looking up as we
approached. "I tried seventeen different configurations. Ran the
numbers four hundred times. The system is beyond repair."

I sat down beside her. "The network idols---"

"Stable. For now." A bitter laugh. "The Foundation stepped in.
Offered them contracts. Most of them signed within hours."

"Most?"

"Thirty-one." She finally looked at me, and her eyes were red-rimmed.
"Thirty-one people trusted my system with their lives, and now they're
Foundation property. Sixteen are still holding out, but\..."

"But they're still connected to your network."

"If I shut it down, they destabilize. If I keep it running, I can
barely maintain them." She laughed again, the sound hollow. "I built a
trap. A beautiful, elegant trap that's killing everyone inside it."

Suiren sat on her other side. "Why did you build it?"

"Because I watched people Fade." Runa's voice cracked. "When I was
new, there was a collapse. Not as big as this, but\... I watched a girl
I knew disappear. One day she was there, the next she was flickering,
and then she was just\... gone. Like she never existed."

She stared at her hands.

"I swore I'd never let that happen again. I studied
everything---Devotion dynamics, network theory, cascade prevention. I
built a system that should have been perfect." Her voice dropped to a
whisper. "I was so sure I'd solved it."

"You tried to help people," I said. "That's not nothing."

"Trying doesn't matter if the result is destruction."

"Hey." Sora crouched in front of her, unusually serious. "You didn't
do this maliciously. You made a mistake. A big one, yeah, but you were
trying to SAVE people."

"The Foundation wasn't." Runa's expression hardened. "They knew my
system was vulnerable. They've known for months. They could have warned
me, helped me fix it. Instead they waited."

"Waited?"

"For exactly this." She stood abruptly, pacing. "Don't you see? They
let it fail. Let me destroy myself and everyone connected to me, so they
could swoop in as saviors. Thirty-one new contracts in three days.
Thirty-one idols who would never have signed with them otherwise."

The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity.

"They engineered this," I said.

"Not engineered. Allowed." Runa's hands were shaking. "There's a
difference, legally. They didn't push the domino. They just made sure
it was positioned perfectly to fall."

"And you have proof of this?"

"I have logs. Communications. A trail of decisions that make no sense
unless you assume they wanted me to fail." She turned to face us. "But
proof doesn't matter if no one will listen. The Foundation controls the
arbitration systems. Controls the rankings. Controls who gets heard and
who gets silenced."

"Then we make them listen," I said.

"How?"

I didn't have an answer yet.

But I was going to find one.

**Chapter 4**

**The Hot Spring Episode, or: The One Where Everyone Is Naked and
Vulnerable**

"This," I said flatly, "is not what I expected when you said
'strategic planning retreat.'"

The Celestial Springs Resort sprawled before us---a traditional hot
spring complex that had somehow been transplanted into the Eternal
Stage. Wooden buildings. Steam rising from natural pools. The distinct
impression that clothing was considered optional at best.

"Strategy requires relaxation!" Sora was already half out of her
traveling clothes. "You can't plan a revolution while tense!"

"I don't think that's historically accurate."

"It's SPIRITUALLY accurate!"

Suiren had already disappeared toward the changing rooms with the
efficiency of someone who had opinions about proper hot spring
etiquette.

Runa stood beside me, looking uncertain. We'd essentially adopted her
after our conversation in the plaza---she had nowhere else to go, and
leaving her alone felt wrong.

"I haven't been to a hot spring since I was a child," she said
quietly.

"Neither have I." I sighed. "Guess we're doing this."


---


The women's bath was everything I'd feared and more.

Steam. Stone. An artfully natural pool that was definitely engineered
for maximum aesthetic appeal. And absolutely no place to hide.

I'd wrapped my towel around myself with the dedication of someone
defending their last remaining dignity, but it was a losing battle. The
towel was small. I was\... not.

"Ika." Suiren was already in the water, her hair floating around her
like a blue-teal halo. She looked like a painting. An extremely nude
painting. "You're being modest."

"One of us should be."

"Why?"

I didn't have a good answer for that.

Sora solved the dilemma by surfacing directly in front of me like some
kind of athletic dolphin. Water streamed down her toned body in ways
that seemed specifically designed to be distracting.

"The water's AMAZING," she declared. "Get in here!"

"I'm working up to it."

"You're stalling!"

"I'm ACCLIMATING."

Runa slipped past me into the pool with considerably less drama, her
smaller frame disappearing into the water up to her shoulders. She
looked almost peaceful for the first time since we'd met.

"It is nice," she admitted.

Peer pressure from three naked women proved to be my limit. I dropped
the towel and got in the water as quickly as possible.

Which, of course, meant Sora got an eyeful.

"WOW," she said, at a volume that was completely unnecessary.
"Just---WOW."

"Please stop."

"I'm appreciating! It's different!"

"It's really not."

Suiren drifted closer, her expression contemplative. "They are quite
impressive. Have you considered---"

"I am NOT having this conversation."

"---specialized support options for competition wear?"

"Oh." I blinked. "That's\... actually a reasonable question."

"I always ask reasonable questions." The ghost of a smile. "What did
you think I was going to say?"

I sank lower into the water and refused to answer.


---


An hour later, I'd moved past embarrassment into something approaching
relaxation.

The four of us had claimed a corner of the pool, steam rising around us,
the tension of the past week slowly bleeding away into the heat.

"So," Sora said, stretching in ways that were completely unnecessary
but very distracting, "strategy. What's our actual plan?"

"Survive the next tournament round," I said. "Gather evidence on The
Foundation. Find allies."

"That's very vague."

"It's a work in progress."

Runa spoke up hesitantly. "The sixteen idols still in my
network---they're holding out because they don't trust The Foundation.
If we could offer them an alternative\..."

"What kind of alternative?"

"I don't know." She stared at the water. "My system failed. I don't
have the right to offer anyone anything."

"You have experience," Suiren said. "Knowledge of what went wrong.
That's valuable."

"It's also dangerous. If The Foundation thinks I'm trying to
rebuild---"

"They'll come after you," I finished. "They'll come after all of
us."

"They already are." Sora's voice was uncharacteristically serious.
"Arya doesn't make social calls. They're planning something."

"The next tournament round," Suiren said. "It's a team competition.
Maximum exposure. Maximum audience."

"Maximum opportunity for them to make an example of us."

We sat with that for a moment. The steam rose. The water bubbled.
Somewhere, someone was definitely not thinking about existential threats
to their existence.

Then Sora stood up, water cascading down her body, and declared: "Well!
If we're going to face possible destruction, we should at least do it
RELAXED."

She proceeded to cannonball into the deeper section of the pool.

The splash hit all of us.

"SORA!"

"What?! It's THERAPEUTIC!"

For a moment---just a moment---I let myself laugh.


---


Later that night, I couldn't sleep.

The resort was quiet. Sora and Runa had passed out hours ago---Sora
sprawled across her futon like a starfish, Runa curled into a tight ball
like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.

I slipped outside into the cool night air.

And found Suiren sitting by a private pool, her feet dangling in the
water.

"Couldn't sleep either?" I asked, settling beside her.

"I rarely can." She didn't look at me. "My mind doesn't quiet
easily."

"What's it saying tonight?"

A long pause. Steam rose between us.

"I was one of them once," she said finally. "A Layer. Erina recruited
me when I was young. Trained me personally."

I'd suspected something like this, but hearing it confirmed still hit
hard. "What happened?"

"I was good. Too good, perhaps. I saw how the system really worked. How
The Foundation didn't protect idols---it consumed them. Extracted value
until they were empty, then discarded them."

"And you left."

"I defected." Her voice was bitter. "Made myself an enemy. Erina
takes betrayal\... personally."

"Is that why they're targeting us? Because of you?"

"Partially. But mostly because of you." She finally met my eyes. "You
represent something they can't control. A path to success that doesn't
require their approval. They'll do anything to destroy that symbol."

"Then why help me? Why risk yourself?"

Suiren was quiet for a long moment.

"Because you treated me like a person," she said softly. "Not a
machine. Not a tool. You looked at me and saw someone worth knowing, not
just someone useful."

"That's a low bar."

"You'd be surprised how few people clear it."

We sat in silence, our feet in the warm water, the stars distant and
strange above us.

"Whatever happens," I said finally, "we face it together. All of
us."

"Together," Suiren agreed.

And for that moment, in the quiet dark, I almost believed we could win.


---


I was heading back to our room when I saw her.

Zuri. The masked one. Standing in the shadows like she'd been waiting.

I froze.

She didn't move. Didn't speak. Just watched me with eyes that
reflected the moonlight.

"What do you want?" I demanded.

Silence.

"If you're here to threaten me---"

"Runa's system didn't fail on its own."

Her voice was soft. Almost mechanical. Each word precisely placed.

"What?"

"The cascade. The timing. It wasn't natural decay." She tilted her
head slightly. "Someone introduced instability at the perfect moment."

"How do you---"

"I know many things." She stepped backward, melting into the shadows.
"The question is what you'll do with this one."

"Wait---"

But she was already gone.

I stood alone in the dark, her words echoing in my head.

The cascade wasn't natural.

Someone had triggered it deliberately.

And Zuri---a Foundation enforcer---had just told me.

Why?

**Chapter 5**

**Stress Test**

The second round of the tournament was a team event.

Three-person squads. A Chase course designed for cooperative pursuit.
Multiple Senpais---yes, apparently there were more than one---scattered
across a massive three-dimensional arena.

First team to catch three Senpais won.

"This is fine," Sora said, vibrating with pre-competition energy.
"This is TOTALLY fine. I am CALM and FOCUSED."

"You're literally bouncing."

"I bounce when I'm calm!"

Our team was me, Sora, and Suiren. Runa had wanted to compete, but her
network obligations made it impossible---she had to stay connected to
her remaining sixteen idols or they'd destabilize.

The Foundation's team was Arya, Opti, and Bea. Zuri was notably
absent---apparently she didn't compete, just\... observed.

Other teams filled the roster---some I recognized, some I didn't. Momo
was on a team with two idols I'd seen around. Akira, the smug genius
who'd dismissed me as "crude" in Volume 1, led her own squad with
barely concealed disdain.

And then there was a team I didn't expect.

"Is that---" Sora squinted at the roster. "Are those Runa's network
idols?"

Three girls in matching outfits, their edges still slightly unstable,
flickering occasionally like bad signal. They shouldn't have been
competing at all in their condition.

But there they were.

"They must be trying to generate Devotion," Suiren said. "Stabilize
themselves through fan support."

"In their condition? That's suicide."

"It's desperation." Her voice was grim. "The Foundation probably
encouraged them. More drama, more audience engagement."

"And if they Fade on stage?"

"Then The Foundation gets a tragic narrative about the dangers of
'unsanctioned systems' and more scared idols signing contracts."

I felt sick.


---


The competition started.

I'll spare you the blow-by-blow---just know that chasing multiple
Senpais across a vertical obstacle course while other teams actively
interfered was exactly as chaotic as it sounds.

Sora was magnificent. She moved like lightning, her crashes and
recoveries so fast they became part of her style. She tagged our first
Senpai within ten minutes.

Suiren was fluid. She flowed through obstacles like water through rocks,
never fighting the course, always finding the path of least resistance.
Our second Senpai fell to her elegant precision.

I was\... me. Aggressive. Shameless. Making moves that shouldn't work
but did because I refused to believe they wouldn't.

We were winning.

And then the screaming started.


---


One of Runa's network idols---the youngest, barely more than a
child---had collapsed mid-course.

She was flickering badly. Worse than before. You could see through her
in patches, her existence stuttering like corrupted video.

"YUKI!" One of her teammates was scrambling toward her, but the course
made it difficult---platforms, gaps, obstacles in the way.

The crowd had gone silent. No one knew what to do.

I looked at the scoreboard. We needed one more Senpai. One more catch
and we won.

I looked at Yuki, fading in real-time in front of thousands of people.

The choice wasn't even a choice.

"Go," I told Sora and Suiren. "Finish the match."

"Ika---"

"GO."

I was already moving toward Yuki.


---


I reached her as her teammates did, the three of us forming a triangle
around her failing body.

"She's not stabilizing," one of them said, panic in her voice. "The
network's pulling too much---Runa's trying to compensate but---"

"Disconnect her."

"If we disconnect her, she Fades immediately!"

"If you DON'T disconnect her, she's pulling you all down with her!"

Yuki's eyes found mine. She was crying, tears tracking down a face that
was becoming transparent.

"I don't want to disappear," she whispered. "Please. I don't want
to be nothing."

"You're not nothing." I grabbed her hand---it felt wrong,
insubstantial, like holding smoke. "You're HERE. People are watching.
People CARE."

"Not enough. There's never enough."

The crowd was reacting now. I could hear them---the shock, the fear, but
also something else.

Sympathy. Concern. Connection.

Devotion.

"EVERYONE WATCHING," I shouted, not sure if my voice would carry but
trying anyway. "HER NAME IS YUKI. SHE'S FIGHTING TO SURVIVE. IF YOU
WANT TO HELP---CARE. FEEL SOMETHING. GIVE HER A REASON TO EXIST."

It was stupid. Desperate. The kind of thing that shouldn't work.

But I felt it---a surge of something warm flowing toward us. The crowd
responding. Thousands of hearts reaching out to one flickering girl.

Yuki's edges stabilized. Just a little. Just enough.

"It's working," her teammate breathed. "Oh god, it's actually
working."

Somewhere behind us, I heard Suiren's voice: "Third capture confirmed.
Team Ika wins."

We'd won.

But looking at Yuki---still faded, still fragile, still barely holding
on---it didn't feel like victory.

It felt like a preview.

**Chapter 6**

**Collapse**

One week later, Runa's system died.

Not slowly. Not gracefully. Not with warning.

It happened during a standard broadcast---Runa performing a routine
maintenance check while her network idols went about their days.
Everything normal. Everything fine.

Then everything wasn't.

I was in our quarters when my display lit up with emergency alerts.
NETWORK FAILURE. MASS DESTABILIZATION. TUNE IN NOW.

We tuned in.

And watched the end of the world.


---


The broadcast showed the Eternal Stage's main plaza. Runa was at the
center, her displays showing cascading red errors, her hands moving
frantically as she tried to stop something that couldn't be stopped.

Around her, her network idols were flickering.

All sixteen of them.

At once.

"No no no no---" Runa's voice was barely audible over the chaos.
"The primary links are failing, I need to reroute through---there's no
bandwidth---I can't---"

One of the idols---an older woman I'd seen around but never spoken
to---fell to her knees. Her edges were blurring. Dissolving.

"Runa!" she screamed. "RUNA, HELP ME!"

"I'm TRYING, I'm---" Runa spun, saw her, and her face crumbled.
"Mei, hold on, I just need to---"

Mei flickered hard. Once. Twice.

Then she was gone.

Just\... gone.

No dramatic last words. No final moment. One second she existed, the
next she didn't.

The space where she'd been was empty. Like she'd never been there at
all.

The crowd that had gathered screamed.

Runa screamed louder.


---


"We have to do something." Sora was already moving toward the door.
"We have to help."

"How?" Suiren grabbed her arm. "We can't stabilize a failing
network. We don't have the ability to generate enough Devotion to save
sixteen people."

"So we just WATCH?!"

On the screen, another idol Faded. Then another. Each one faster than
the last, the cascade accelerating as it consumed everything in its
path.

Runa was in the center of it, trying to physically hold onto people who
were becoming less real by the second. Her hands passed through them.
Nothing she did mattered.

"I'm sorry," she was sobbing. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean---I was trying to help---I'm SORRY---"

Yuki---the girl I'd saved during the tournament---was still standing.
Barely. Her edges were wrong, her existence stuttering, but she was
fighting.

"Yuki, disconnect yourself!" Runa shouted. "Cut the link before it
takes you!"

"I can't!" The girl was crying. "If I disconnect I Fade anyway!"

"You might survive if---"

"There IS no survival!" Yuki's voice cracked. "There never was! You
just made us think there was!"

Runa flinched like she'd been slapped.

Around them, more idols flickered. More idols fell.

The cascade was almost complete.


---


By the time it ended, twelve idols had Faded.

Twelve people who existed that morning were simply\... gone. Erased from
reality. Their names would be forgotten. Their faces would blur in
memory. Eventually, it would be like they'd never existed at all.

Four survived. Yuki was one of them---barely, her form still unstable,
her existence held together by threads and stubbornness.

And Runa\...

Runa was still standing in the plaza, surrounded by empty space where
sixteen people used to be.

She wasn't crying anymore. She wasn't screaming.

She was just\... standing there. Staring at her hands. The hands that
had built a system meant to save people and ended up destroying them.

The Foundation's response was immediate.

Erina herself appeared on broadcast within the hour. Poised. Polished.
Sympathetic in a way that felt calculated down to the millisecond.

"This tragedy demonstrates the dangers of unsanctioned systems," she
said, her voice carrying perfectly. "Runa's intentions may have been
good, but good intentions are not enough. The Foundation exists to
provide stability. Structure. Safety."

She paused for effect.

"To any idols feeling vulnerable right now---The Foundation's doors
are open. We can protect you. We can ensure this never happens to you."

The subtext was clear: sign with us or risk ending up like them.

"She's using this," Sora said, her voice hollow. "Twelve people died
and she's using it as a RECRUITMENT OPPORTUNITY."

"That's what she does." Suiren's expression was cold. "That's what
she's always done."

I said nothing.

I was thinking about Zuri's words at the hot spring.

*The cascade wasn't natural. Someone introduced instability at the
perfect moment.*

Someone.

I was starting to have a very good idea who.


---


We found Runa where we'd left her. Still in the plaza. Still staring at
nothing.

The crowd had dispersed. The emergency responders had come and gone.
Someone had put a blanket around her shoulders at some point. She
hadn't seemed to notice.

"Runa." I knelt in front of her. "Runa, we need to go."

No response.

"Runa."

"I killed them." Her voice was barely a whisper. "I built a system
and I killed them."

"You didn't---"

"I DID." Something broke in her expression---the numbness cracking
into raw, agonizing grief. "I told them they'd be safe. I PROMISED.
And they trusted me, and now they're GONE, and it's my fault, it's
all my fault---"

"The system was sabotaged."

She stopped. Looked at me.

"What?"

"The cascade wasn't natural decay. Someone introduced instability at
exactly the right moment to cause maximum damage." I held her gaze.
"You didn't fail. You were MADE to fail."

"How do you know that?"

"A source I can't explain." I stood, offering her my hand. "But I'm
going to find proof. And when I do, the people responsible are going to
pay."

Runa stared at my hand for a long moment.

Then, slowly, she took it.

"I want to help," she said. "I need to---I need to DO something. I
can't just---"

"Then help." I pulled her to her feet. "Help us take them down."

For the first time since the collapse, something other than despair
flickered in her eyes.

It looked like rage.

**Chapter 7**

**Aftermath**

The next three days were chaos.

The Foundation moved fast. Bea was everywhere---at survivor support
sessions, at recovery meetings, anywhere scared idols gathered. Her
pitch was always the same: reasonable terms, guaranteed stability, sign
here and never worry again.

The fine print told a different story, but most people weren't reading
the fine print.

Twenty-three new contracts in seventy-two hours.

The independent idol population was bleeding out, and The Foundation was
there with bandages and chains disguised as salvation.

"We're losing," Sora said during our strategy meeting. "Every day
more people sign. Every day The Foundation gets stronger."

"Then we need to accelerate our timeline." I spread out the evidence
we'd gathered---logs, communications records, the trail Runa had been
assembling before everything collapsed. "We have enough to prove they
let the system fail deliberately."

"Proving it and making people CARE are different things," Suiren
pointed out. "The Foundation controls the narrative. Even if we show
evidence, they'll spin it."

"Then we don't just show evidence." Runa's voice was hard. She'd
changed since the collapse---the sweetness burned away, leaving
something sharper underneath. "We make it undeniable. We expose them so
thoroughly that no spin can save them."

"How?"

"The tournament finals are in five days. Maximum audience. Every idol
watching. Every fan engaged." She pulled up a display. "If we can
access The Foundation's internal communications---the real ones, not
the sanitized versions---and broadcast them live\..."

"That's impossible," Sora said. "Their security is---"

"I know someone who can help."

We all looked at Runa.

"During my network's construction, I worked with someone inside The
Foundation. A technical specialist who disagreed with their methods."
She hesitated. "We lost contact after I went independent, but if I can
reach her\..."

"You're talking about a mole," Suiren said. "Inside The Foundation.
Someone who's been hiding for years."

"I'm talking about the only chance we have."

I thought about Zuri. Her warning. Her information.

Maybe there were more cracks in The Foundation than we knew.

"Do it," I said. "Reach out. Whatever it takes."


---


Erina came to us that night.

Not her Layers. Not her representatives. Her, personally, walking into
our quarters like she owned them.

Which, I supposed, she technically did. The Eternal Stage was Foundation
territory, after all.

"Ika." She smiled---warm, genuine-seeming, utterly false. "I thought
we should talk. Without the intermediaries."

"I have nothing to say to you."

"Then listen." She settled into a chair, elegant even in the simple
motion. "I'm not your enemy. I know you think I am, but our goals
aren't as different as you believe."

"Your goal is control. Mine is freedom."

"My goal is SURVIVAL." Something flickered in her
expression---something almost human. "Do you know what happened before
The Foundation existed? Do you know what the idol world looked like?"

"I know what it looks like now. I know what you did to Runa's
network."

"What Runa did to herself, you mean."

"Don't." My voice was ice. "Don't pretend you didn't orchestrate
that collapse."

"I didn't orchestrate anything." She leaned forward. "I simply\...
chose not to prevent it. There's a difference."

"Twelve people are DEAD."

"Twelve people are Faded. And yes, that's tragic. But how many would
have Faded over the next year without intervention? Twenty? Thirty?
Runa's system was unstable from the beginning. I gave it time to prove
itself. It failed."

"You LET it fail."

"I let reality demonstrate the flaws in unsanctioned approaches." Her
voice hardened. "You want to be free? Fine. But freedom without
structure leads to exactly what you saw in that plaza. Chaos.
Destruction. Innocent people paying the price for idealism."

"And your structure? Your control? People sign away their lives for
'protection' and end up as resources to be extracted."

"They end up ALIVE." Erina stood abruptly. "You don't understand
what I've built. What I've prevented. The idol world was a bloodbath
before The Foundation---thousands Fading every year, no stability, no
safety, just endless desperate competition for scraps of Devotion."

"So you made yourself the gatekeeper. You decided who lives and dies."

"Someone had to." Her mask was slipping---I could see the genuine
belief underneath. She thought she was right. That was the worst part.
"Someone had to impose order. Give structure to chaos. Protect people
from themselves."

"You became a tyrant to prevent tyranny."

"I became NECESSARY." She was at the door now, composure reassembling.
"This is your last chance, Ika. Join The Foundation. Use your influence
to help us stabilize the situation. Or\..."

"Or what?"

"Or learn what happens to symbols that can't be co-opted."

She left.

I stood in the silence she'd left behind, her words echoing.

Not a threat. A promise.

The war was coming.

Ready or not.

**Chapter 8**

**Conspiracy**

Runa's contact came through.

Her name was Iris---or at least, that was the name she used. A technical
specialist who'd been inside The Foundation for years, watching,
waiting, gathering evidence against the system she was forced to serve.

We met in a maintenance tunnel beneath the Eternal Stage, far from
Foundation surveillance.

"You're smaller than I expected," Iris said, looking at me. She was
plain in a way that seemed intentional---forgettable features,
unremarkable clothes, the kind of person your eyes slid past without
registering.

"I get that a lot." I didn't. "What do you have for us?"

"Everything." She produced a data crystal. "Communications proving
The Foundation monitored Runa's system for months. Knew exactly when it
would fail. Chose to let it happen rather than intervene."

"That's enough to---"

"That's not all." Her expression darkened. "There's evidence of
systematic interference going back years. Promising independent idols
who 'mysteriously' destabilized. Rival networks that
'coincidentally' collapsed. A pattern of eliminating competition
disguised as natural failure."

Suiren's breath caught. "How many?"

"Over the past decade? Hundreds. Maybe thousands." Iris's voice was
bitter. "Erina built her empire on graves. She just made sure no one
could prove it."

"Until now," Runa said.

"Until now. But there's a problem."

Of course there was.

"The data is encrypted. Foundation-grade security. I can give you the
raw files, but without the decryption keys, they're useless."

"Where are the keys?"

"Erina carries them personally. A secure device she never lets out of
her sight."

"So we need to steal from Erina directly."

"During the tournament finals. When she's distracted, publicly
visible, surrounded by people." Iris almost smiled. "Maximum risk.
Maximum reward."

I looked at my team. Sora, vibrating with barely contained energy.
Suiren, calculating odds with cold precision. Runa, rage burning beneath
her grief.

"We can do this," I said. "But we'll need a distraction. Something
big enough to pull all eyes away from Erina."

"Oh," Sora said, her grin returning. "I have some ideas about that."


---


The plan came together over the next two days.

Step one: Compete in the tournament finals. Generate enough attention
that The Foundation couldn't look away.

Step two: During the competition, Suiren would separate from the team.
She knew Foundation protocols, knew their security systems. She could
get close to Erina without triggering alarms.

Step three: Runa, working from a hidden location, would broadcast the
decrypted data the moment we had access. Every screen in the Eternal
Stage. Every feed. Every platform.

Step four: Survive whatever came next.

"This is insane," I said, staring at our planning display. "There are
a hundred ways this could go wrong."

"Name three."

"Suiren gets caught. The decryption fails. Erina anticipates the whole
thing and has us arrested before we start."

"That's three." Sora shrugged. "We've got contingencies."

"Our contingency is 'improvise.'"

"It's worked so far!"

Suiren touched my arm. "We don't have to do this. We could run. Hide.
Find somewhere The Foundation's reach doesn't extend."

"Does that place exist?"

She was silent.

"Then we fight." I turned to face them all. "We expose them. We burn
it down. And whatever happens after that, at least people will know the
truth."

"Inspiring speech," Runa said dryly. "You practice that?"

"Only a little."

"It shows."

For a moment, despite everything, we laughed.

Then we got back to planning our impossible heist.

**Chapter 9**

**The Impossible Choice**

The tournament finals were the biggest event of the season.

Every idol who hadn't Faded was there. Every fan who could get access.
The Eternal Stage's central arena was packed beyond capacity,
holographic displays extending the audience to millions more watching
remotely.

The format was simple: Solo Chase. One Senpai. A massive course spanning
the entire arena. Last idol standing wins.

No teams. No allies. Just you against everyone else.

"Remember the plan," I murmured to Suiren as we waited at the starting
line. "When I give the signal---"

"I know what to do." Her cool eyes met mine. "Focus on your part.
I'll handle mine."

Sora was bouncing on her heels beside me, energy barely contained.
"I've got a good feeling about this!"

"You say that every time."

"And I'm usually right!"

"You're really not."

The countdown began.

"IKA." Sora grabbed my arm, suddenly serious. "Whatever happens in
there---I'm glad I found you. Outside the Stage that day. I'm glad you
woke up."

"Don't talk like that. It sounds like a goodbye."

"It's not." Her grin returned. "Just a 'thank you.' For seeing
me."

The horn sounded.

We ran.


---


The competition was chaos.

Fifty idols pursuing one Senpai across a course that seemed designed by
sadists. Climbing walls that moved. Platforms that disappeared.
Obstacles that rearranged themselves every few minutes.

And through it all, Senpai moved like a ghost---always ahead, always
just out of reach, his face never quite visible despite how close we
got.

I was near the front of the pack. Years of streaming workout routines
had given me endurance most idols couldn't match, and my qualifying run
had taught me how to move efficiently.

Sora was ahead of me, pushing hard. Too hard. I could see the familiar
signs---the stutter in her movements, the flicker at the edges of her
form.

"Sora!" I shouted. "Slow down!"

She didn't hear me. Or didn't listen.

Suiren had already peeled off toward the VIP section, where Erina
watched the competition with her Layers arranged around her like a
court.

Phase one was working.

Then everything went wrong.


---


It happened without warning.

Sora was climbing a vertical section, pushing through despite the
strain. She was almost to the top when her body seized.

Not a normal crash. Something worse.

Her edges began to blur.

"SORA!"

She fell. Twenty feet, straight down, landing hard on a platform below.
She didn't get up.

I abandoned the competition, abandoned Senpai, abandoned everything.
Nothing mattered except reaching her.

When I got there, she was flickering.

Not like Runa's network idols. Not a system failure. This was something
internal---her existence itself destabilizing from too much strain, too
many crashes, too much pushing herself beyond her limits.

"Hey," I said, kneeling beside her. "Hey, stay with me."

"Ika\..." Her voice was wrong. Distant. Like she was already somewhere
else. "I pushed too hard, didn't I?"

"You're going to be fine. You just need to rest, stabilize---"

"I can feel it." Her hand found mine---barely solid, wavering like
heat shimmer. "Fading. It's\... not as scary as I thought. Just\...
quiet."

"Stop it. STOP IT." Tears were streaming down my face. "You're not
Fading. I won't let you."

"You can't stop it." She smiled---that bright, manic, beautiful
smile. "No one can. That's the point. We all Fade eventually. We're
just\... stories. Stories that walk around for a while."

"You're not just a story."

"I know." Her flickering fingers squeezed mine. "I'm YOUR story.
That's enough."

Around us, the competition continued. Other idols ran past, focused on
Senpai, focused on winning. Most didn't even notice us.

But the crowd noticed. The cameras noticed.

And somewhere, I knew, Erina was watching.


---


"IKA."

Suiren's voice in my earpiece, urgent.

"I'm a little BUSY right now---"

"I know. I can see. But you need to hear this."

"What?"

"Erina just activated something. A system override. I don't know what
it does, but every unsanctioned idol in the arena is showing
destabilization warnings."

My blood went cold.

"She's forcing a mass Fade. Everyone who didn't sign with The
Foundation---she's going to make them all Fade at once. Blame it on the
'inherent instability' of independent systems."

"How many?"

"Fifteen. Maybe twenty. Including the survivors from Runa's network."

Including Yuki. Including every independent idol who'd refused to sign.

Including me.

I looked at Sora. Still flickering. Still fading.

I looked at the arena around us. At the other idols who didn't know
death was coming for them.

One friend. Twenty strangers.

I couldn't save both.


---


"Suiren. Can you stop the override?"

"Maybe. If I can get to the control nexus. But it's heavily guarded,
and if I leave now, I lose access to Erina's data."

"Forget the data. Save the others."

"Ika---"

"I said FORGET IT." My voice cracked. "The data doesn't matter if
there's no one left to save."

"And Sora?"

I looked at my friend. My first friend here. The person who'd found me
when I was nothing, who'd believed in me when I didn't believe in
myself.

She was looking at me too. Her eyes were dim, distant, but she heard.

"Go," she whispered.

"Sora---"

"Go save them." Her smile was faint but real. "I always knew I'd
burn out eventually. Better than fading away."

"I can't leave you."

"You can't save everyone." Her hand slipped from mine---not letting
go, just\... losing cohesion. "But you can save more than just me. So
go. Be the hero. It's a better story anyway."

I was frozen. Paralyzed by an impossible choice.

Save my friend.

Save the many.

Not enough time for both.

Never enough time.

Sora's edges flickered harder. The destabilization alerts screamed in
my earpiece. Somewhere, Erina was watching, waiting to see what I'd do.

*You can't save everyone.*

But I had to try.

I made my choice.

I started to move---


---


And then everything went white.

*To be continued in Volume 3: "The Reckoning"*

Afterword

\...

I'm not going to tell you what I chose.

Not yet.

I know that's cruel. I know you've been reading this whole thing
waiting to find out what happens, and now I'm leaving you hanging on
the worst possible moment.

But here's the thing about impossible choices: they reveal who we
really are. Not who we think we are, not who we want to be, but who we
ARE when everything is stripped away and we have to act.

I made my choice in that moment. In the white. In the silence between
one heartbeat and the next.

And I'm going to have to live with it forever.

But you don't get to know what it was. Not yet. Not until you've sat
with that moment yourself. Until you've asked yourself: what would I
do?

Save the friend who believed in me first?

Or save the many who never knew my name?

Think about it.

Really think.

Because in the end, we're all one impossible choice away from
discovering who we truly are.

See you in Volume 3.
