# Infinite Idol Marketing Team - Guide for Non-Developers

> **What is this?** This is a plain-language guide explaining how the Infinite Idol AI marketing team works. No coding knowledge required.

---

## What Is This Project?

**Infinite Idol** is a mobile game about anime idols competing in an endless chase. Think gacha games like Genshin Impact, but with idol competitions and built on blockchain technology.

This repository is the **marketing department** for that game - except instead of hiring a team of people, we've built a team of **19 AI agents** that create all the marketing content automatically.

### Why AI Agents?

Traditional marketing teams require:
- Content writers who create tweets and posts
- Lore experts who ensure story consistency
- Community managers who engage with fans
- Asset creators who make visual prompts
- Coordinators who manage everything
- Crisis managers, influencer relations, viral engineers, and more

Instead of hiring 19 people, we've created **19 specialized AI agents** that handle all these roles 24/7. They work together, review each other's work, and only ask humans when they need important decisions made.

---

## How Does It Work? (Simple Version)

### The Process

1. **Tasks get added** to a queue (like a to-do list)
2. **Agents pick up tasks** based on their specialty
3. **Agents create content** (tweets, art prompts, story threads)
4. **Other agents review** the content for quality
5. **Content gets approved** and published to social media

### The Quality Control System

Every piece of content goes through a review chain:

```
Content Strategist creates tweet
   ↓
Lore Guardian checks: "Does this match the story?"
   ↓
Resident Degen checks: "Is this cool enough for our audience?"
   ↓
Coordinator approves: "Ship it!"
   ↓
Published to Twitter/Discord
```

This ensures everything we publish is:
- **Accurate** (matches the game's story)
- **On-brand** (sounds like Infinite Idol)
- **Culturally relevant** (resonates with crypto/gaming/anime communities)

## The 10 Inviolable Facts (The Sacred Rules)

These are the **10 absolute truths** about Infinite Idol that can NEVER be contradicted. Every piece of content must respect these facts:

| # | Fact | Meaning |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **Devotion Sustains Existence** | Without fan devotion, idols literally cease to exist |
| 2 | **Fading is Permanent Death** | No resurrection. No reversal. No afterlife. |
| 3 | **The Faded Are Forgotten** | When someone Fades, memories of them blur and disappear |
| 4 | **Senpai is the Unattainable Goal** | Every idol chases Senpai. What catching him MEANS is mysterious |
| 5 | **Senpai's Face Never Revealed** | We (audience) never see Senpai's face |
| 6 | **The Foundation Controls the System** | They run the industry's SYSTEM, not everything |
| 7 | **The Chase is Survival** | Competition isn't optional. Refusing = Fading |
| 8 | **Fan Service Fuels Devotion** | Fan service is survival, not vanity |
| 9 | **The System Predates Its Masters** | Origins unknown, existed before current Foundation |
| 10 | **No One Knows What Catching Senpai Means** | The ultimate mystery |

*Note: Character details (Ika's 47 fans, hair color) and business decisions (blockchain choice, currency names) are NOT inviolable—see CLAUDE.md for the full authoritative list.*

If any agent creates content that violates these facts, it gets rejected immediately.

## How to Review and Approve Content

When agents create content that needs human approval, it appears in the **Reviews** section.

### Review Process

1. **Open the Dashboard** and navigate to Reviews
2. **Read the content** carefully
3. **Check for:**
   - Does it sound like Infinite Idol?
   - Is it accurate to the story?
   - Would the target audience (gamers/crypto folks/anime fans) like it?
   - Does it violate any of the 10 Inviolable Facts?
4. **Click Approve** if it's good, or **Reject** with feedback if not

### When to Escalate

Some decisions need human judgment:
- **Major plot reveals** - Big story changes
- **New canon** - Adding something new to the story that wasn't established
- **Budget decisions** - Anything costing real money
- **Character deaths** - Permanently removing a character
- **Partnership proposals** - Collaborations with other projects

If an agent escalates something to you, it means they need your decision before proceeding.

## Common Questions

### How do agents know what to do?

Agents read from a **task queue** (a markdown file) that lists all pending work. Each task has:
- A unique ID (like CONTENT-001)
- A description of what needs to be done
- An assigned agent
- A priority level
- Dependencies (what needs to be done first)

### Can agents make mistakes?

Yes, which is why we have the multi-agent review system. If an agent writes something that contradicts the story, the Lore Guardian catches it. If something feels culturally out of touch, the Resident Degen rejects it.

### What happens if I disagree with approved content?

You can:
1. Open the Reviews section and reject the content
2. Provide feedback explaining what needs to change
3. The agent will revise and resubmit

### How often do agents work?

The system is configured to run automatically at:
- **9 AM JST** - Morning content check
- **6 PM JST** - Evening content creation
- **9 PM JST** - Pre-sleep content push

You can also manually trigger agents anytime via the dashboard.

### What if there's an emergency?

Any agent can trigger an **emergency response**:
1. All agents are notified
2. The Coordinator takes lead
3. Work on the emergency takes priority over everything else
4. You'll be notified immediately

Examples: Negative community reaction, PR crisis, major competitor announcement

### How much does this cost?

The AI agents run on Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is included in Claude Code subscriptions. No per-use API fees.

The dashboard is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no paid frameworks or hosting required.

### Can I add more agents?

Yes, but you'd need to:
1. Create a new persona file in `agents/`
2. Update CLAUDE.md with the new agent
3. Update the dashboard to display the new agent
4. Give the agent specific responsibilities and file permissions

### What if agents can't decide something?

Agents are programmed to escalate to human review when they're uncertain. You'll see these items in the **Reviews** section marked as "Escalated" with an explanation of what they need help with.

## Philosophy

### Why This Approach?

Traditional marketing teams face challenges:
- **Consistency** - Different people write differently
- **Availability** - People sleep, take vacations, get sick
- **Scalability** - Hiring is expensive and slow
- **Knowledge gaps** - New team members need training

The AI agent system solves these:
- **Perfect consistency** - Every agent reads the same source material
- **24/7 operation** - Agents never sleep
- **Instant scaling** - Add new agents by writing a persona file
- **Perfect knowledge** - Agents always have access to all lore/brand docs

### What Agents Can't Do (Yet)

- **Strategic pivots** - Major business decisions still need humans
- **Crisis management** - Sensitive situations need human judgment
- **Creative breakthroughs** - Truly novel ideas often need human insight
- **Emotional intelligence** - Reading community sentiment has limits

### The Future

This system will evolve:
- **Analytics integration** - Agents will see what content performs best
- **Automated publishing** - Content goes live without manual posting
- **Community listening** - Agents read Discord/Twitter and respond
- **Seasonal campaigns** - Full campaign creation from concept to execution

---

## Final Notes

This system represents a **new way of doing marketing** - not replacing humans, but augmenting them. The agents handle the repetitive work (content creation, quality checks, scheduling) so humans can focus on strategy, creative direction, and high-stakes decisions.

Think of it as having a 19-person marketing team that:
- Works 24/7
- Never forgets anything
- Always stays on-brand
- Costs a fraction of hiring humans
- Covers everything from content creation to crisis management

But still needs human oversight for the important stuff.

*"Every idol needs fans. Every agent needs direction. Every system needs a human touch."*
