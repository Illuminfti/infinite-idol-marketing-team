## What This Is

This directory contains **reference personas** that were part of the original 20-agent design. They describe roles that either:

1. **Require human execution** (Discord access, Twitter posting, partnerships)
2. **Duplicate functionality** now covered by consolidated agents
3. **Need external integrations** not available to Claude Code
